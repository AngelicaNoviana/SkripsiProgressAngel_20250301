"Sequential Interpretability: Methods, Applications, and Future Direction
  for Understanding Deep Learning Models in the Context of Sequential Data","  Deep learning continues to revolutionize an ever-growing number of critical
application areas including healthcare, transportation, finance, and basic
sciences. Despite their increased predictive power, model transparency and
human explainability remain a significant challenge due to the ""black box""
nature of modern deep learning models. In many cases the desired balance
between interpretability and performance is predominately task specific.
Human-centric domains such as healthcare necessitate a renewed focus on
understanding how and why these frameworks are arriving at critical and
potentially life-or-death decisions. Given the quantity of research and
empirical successes of deep learning for computer vision, most of the existing
interpretability research has focused on image processing techniques.
Comparatively, less attention has been paid to interpreting deep learning
frameworks using sequential data. Given recent deep learning advancements in
highly sequential domains such as natural language processing and physiological
signal processing, the need for deep sequential explanations is at an all-time
high. In this paper, we review current techniques for interpreting deep
learning techniques involving sequential data, identify similarities to
non-sequential methods, and discuss current limitations and future avenues of
sequential interpretability research.

Putting Natural in Natural Language Processing,"  Human language is firstly spoken and only secondarily written. Text, however,
is a very convenient and efficient representation of language, and modern
civilization has made it ubiquitous. Thus the field of NLP has overwhelmingly
focused on processing written rather than spoken language. Work on spoken
language, on the other hand, has been siloed off within the largely separate
speech processing community which has been inordinately preoccupied with
transcribing speech into text. Recent advances in deep learning have led to a
fortuitous convergence in methods between speech processing and mainstream NLP.
Arguably, the time is ripe for a unification of these two fields, and for
starting to take spoken language seriously as the primary mode of human
communication. Truly natural language processing could lead to better
integration with the rest of language science and could lead to systems which
are more data-efficient and more human-like, and which can communicate beyond
the textual modality.

Deep Learning for Political Science,"  Political science, and social science in general, have traditionally been
using computational methods to study areas such as voting behavior, policy
making, international conflict, and international development. More recently,
increasingly available quantities of data are being combined with improved
algorithms and affordable computational resources to predict, learn, and
discover new insights from data that is large in volume and variety. New
developments in the areas of machine learning, deep learning, natural language
processing (NLP), and, more generally, artificial intelligence (AI) are opening
up new opportunities for testing theories and evaluating the impact of
interventions and programs in a more dynamic and effective way. Applications
using large volumes of structured and unstructured data are becoming common in
government and industry, and increasingly also in social science research. This
chapter offers an introduction to such methods drawing examples from political
science. Focusing on the areas where the strengths of the methods coincide with
challenges in these fields, the chapter first presents an introduction to AI
and its core technology - machine learning, with its rapidly developing
subfield of deep learning. The discussion of deep neural networks is
illustrated with the NLP tasks that are relevant to political science. The
latest advances in deep learning methods for NLP are also reviewed, together
with their potential for improving information extraction and pattern
recognition from political science texts.

"Identifying Semantically Duplicate Questions Using Data Science
  Approach: A Quora Case Study","  Identifying semantically identical questions on, Question and Answering
social media platforms like Quora is exceptionally significant to ensure that
the quality and the quantity of content are presented to users, based on the
intent of the question and thus enriching overall user experience. Detecting
duplicate questions is a challenging problem because natural language is very
expressive, and a unique intent can be conveyed using different words, phrases,
and sentence structuring. Machine learning and deep learning methods are known
to have accomplished superior results over traditional natural language
processing techniques in identifying similar texts. In this paper, taking Quora
for our case study, we explored and applied different machine learning and deep
learning techniques on the task of identifying duplicate questions on Quora's
dataset. By using feature engineering, feature importance techniques, and
experimenting with seven selected machine learning classifiers, we demonstrated
that our models outperformed previous studies on this task. Xgboost model with
character level term frequency and inverse term frequency is our best machine
learning model that has also outperformed a few of the Deep learning baseline
models. We applied deep learning techniques to model four different deep neural
networks of multiple layers consisting of Glove embeddings, Long Short Term
Memory, Convolution, Max pooling, Dense, Batch Normalization, Activation
functions, and model merge. Our deep learning models achieved better accuracy
than machine learning models. Three out of four proposed architectures
outperformed the accuracy from previous machine learning and deep learning
research work, two out of four models outperformed accuracy from previous deep
learning study on Quora's question pair dataset, and our best model achieved
accuracy of 85.82% which is close to Quora state of the art accuracy.

Vulgar Remarks Detection in Chittagonian Dialect of Bangla,"  The negative effects of online bullying and harassment are increasing with
Internet popularity, especially in social media. One solution is using natural
language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) methods for the automatic
detection of harmful remarks, but these methods are limited in low-resource
languages like the Chittagonian dialect of Bangla.This study focuses on
detecting vulgar remarks in social media using supervised ML and deep learning
algorithms.Logistic Regression achieved promising accuracy (0.91) while simple
RNN with Word2vec and fastTex had lower accuracy (0.84-0.90), highlighting the
issue that NN algorithms require more data.

"Development of Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing Model for
  Turkish","  Natural language is one of the most fundamental features that distinguish
people from other living things and enable people to communicate each other.
Language is a tool that enables people to express their feelings and thoughts
and to transfers cultures through generations. Texts and audio are examples of
natural language in daily life. In the natural language, many words disappear
in time, on the other hand new words are derived. Therefore, while the process
of natural language processing (NLP) is complex even for human, it is difficult
to process in computer system. The area of linguistics examines how people use
language. NLP, which requires the collaboration of linguists and computer
scientists, plays an important role in human computer interaction. Studies in
NLP have increased with the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the
field of linguistics. With the deep learning methods which are one of the
artificial intelligence study areas, platforms close to natural language are
being developed. Developed platforms for language comprehension, machine
translation and part of speech (POS) tagging benefit from deep learning
methods. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), one of the deep learning
architectures, is preferred for processing sequential data such as text or
audio data. In this study, Turkish POS tagging model has been proposed by using
Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) which is an RNN type. The proposed
POS tagging model is provided to natural language researchers with a platform
that allows them to perform and use their own analysis. In the development
phase of the platform developed by using BLSTM, the error rate of the POS
tagger has been reduced by taking feedback with expert opinion.

"Scientific Language Modeling: A Quantitative Review of Large Language
  Models in Molecular Science","  Efficient molecular modeling and design are crucial for the discovery and
exploration of novel molecules, and the incorporation of deep learning methods
has revolutionized this field. In particular, large language models (LLMs)
offer a fresh approach to tackle scientific problems from a natural language
processing (NLP) perspective, introducing a research paradigm called scientific
language modeling (SLM). However, two key issues remain: how to quantify the
match between model and data modalities and how to identify the
knowledge-learning preferences of models. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-modal benchmark, named ChEBI-20-MM, and perform 1263
experiments to assess the model's compatibility with data modalities and
knowledge acquisition. Through the modal transition probability matrix, we
provide insights into the most suitable modalities for tasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a statistically interpretable approach to discover context-specific
knowledge mapping by localized feature filtering. Our pioneering analysis
offers an exploration of the learning mechanism and paves the way for advancing
SLM in molecular science.

A Review of Deep Learning Techniques for Protein Function Prediction,"  Deep Learning and big data have shown tremendous success in bioinformatics
and computational biology in recent years; artificial intelligence methods have
also significantly contributed in the task of protein function classification.
This review paper analyzes the recent developments in approaches for the task
of predicting protein function using deep learning. We explain the importance
of determining the protein function and why automating the following task is
crucial. Then, after reviewing the widely used deep learning techniques for
this task, we continue our review and highlight the emergence of the modern
State of The Art (SOTA) deep learning models which have achieved groundbreaking
results in the field of computer vision, natural language processing and

"Text Analysis Using Deep Neural Networks in Digital Humanities and
  Information Science","  Combining computational technologies and humanities is an ongoing effort
aimed at making resources such as texts, images, audio, video, and other
artifacts digitally available, searchable, and analyzable. In recent years,
deep neural networks (DNN) dominate the field of automatic text analysis and
natural language processing (NLP), in some cases presenting a super-human
performance. DNNs are the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms solving
many NLP tasks that are relevant for Digital Humanities (DH) research, such as
spell checking, language detection, entity extraction, author detection,
question answering, and other tasks. These supervised algorithms learn patterns
from a large number of ""right"" and ""wrong"" examples and apply them to new
examples. However, using DNNs for analyzing the text resources in DH research
presents two main challenges: (un)availability of training data and a need for
domain adaptation. This paper explores these challenges by analyzing multiple
use-cases of DH studies in recent literature and their possible solutions and
lays out a practical decision model for DH experts for when and how to choose
the appropriate deep learning approaches for their research. Moreover, in this
paper, we aim to raise awareness of the benefits of utilizing deep learning
models in the DH community.

"Modular Mechanistic Networks: On Bridging Mechanistic and
  Phenomenological Models with Deep Neural Networks in Natural Language

driven) and bottom-up (data driven) approaches, which we call mechanistic and
phenomenological respectively. The approaches are frequently considered to
stand in opposition to each other. Examining some recent approaches in deep
learning we argue that deep neural networks incorporate both perspectives and,
furthermore, that leveraging this aspect of deep learning may help in solving
complex problems within language technology, such as modelling language and
perception in the domain of spatial cognition.

Application Specific Compression of Deep Learning Models,"  Large Deep Learning models are compressed and deployed for specific
applications. However, current Deep Learning model compression methods do not
utilize the information about the target application. As a result, the
compressed models are application agnostic. Our goal is to customize the model
compression process to create a compressed model that will perform better for
the target application. Our method, Application Specific Compression (ASC),
identifies and prunes components of the large Deep Learning model that are
redundant specifically for the given target application. The intuition of our
work is to prune the parts of the network that do not contribute significantly
to updating the data representation for the given application. We have
experimented with the BERT family of models for three applications: Extractive
QA, Natural Language Inference, and Paraphrase Identification. We observe that
customized compressed models created using ASC method perform better than
existing model compression methods and off-the-shelf compressed models.

"Deep learning for nano-photonic materials -- The solution to

all kinds of difficult problems that computers have not been able to solve in

"Integrating AI Planning with Natural Language Processing: A Combination
  of Explicit and Tacit Knowledge","  Natural language processing (NLP) aims at investigating the interactions
between agents and humans, processing and analyzing large amounts of natural
language data. Large-scale language models play an important role in current
natural language processing. However, the challenges of explainability and
complexity come along with the developments of language models. One way is to
introduce logical relations and rules into natural language processing models,
such as making use of Automated Planning. Automated planning (AI planning)
focuses on building symbolic domain models and synthesizing plans to transit
initial states to goals based on domain models. Recently, there have been
plenty of works related to these two fields, which have the abilities to
generate explicit knowledge, e.g., preconditions and effects of action models,
and learn from tacit knowledge, e.g., neural models, respectively. Integrating
AI planning and natural language processing effectively improves the
communication between human and intelligent agents. This paper outlines the
commons and relations between AI planning and natural language processing,
argues that each of them can effectively impact on the other one by five areas:
(1) planning-based text understanding, (2) planning-based natural language
processing, (3) planning-based explainability, (4) text-based human-robot
interaction, and (5) applications. We also explore some potential future issues
between AI planning and natural language processing. To the best of our
knowledge, this survey is the first work that addresses the deep connections
between AI planning and Natural language processing.

Changes from Classical Statistics to Modern Statistics and Data Science,"  A coordinate system is a foundation for every quantitative science,
engineering, and medicine. Classical physics and statistics are based on the
Cartesian coordinate system. The classical probability and hypothesis testing
theory can only be applied to Euclidean data. However, modern data in the real
world are from natural language processing, mathematical formulas, social
networks, transportation and sensor networks, computer visions, automations,
and biomedical measurements. The Euclidean assumption is not appropriate for
non Euclidean data. This perspective addresses the urgent need to overcome
those fundamental limitations and encourages extensions of classical
probability theory and hypothesis testing , diffusion models and stochastic
differential equations from Euclidean space to non Euclidean space. Artificial
intelligence such as natural language processing, computer vision, graphical
neural networks, manifold regression and inference theory, manifold learning,
graph neural networks, compositional diffusion models for automatically
compositional generations of concepts and demystifying machine learning
systems, has been rapidly developed. Differential manifold theory is the
mathematic foundations of deep learning and data science as well. We urgently
need to shift the paradigm for data analysis from the classical Euclidean data
analysis to both Euclidean and non Euclidean data analysis and develop more and
more innovative methods for describing, estimating and inferring non Euclidean
geometries of modern real datasets. A general framework for integrated analysis
of both Euclidean and non Euclidean data, composite AI, decision intelligence
and edge AI provide powerful innovative ideas and strategies for fundamentally
advancing AI. We are expected to marry statistics with AI, develop a unified
theory of modern statistics and drive next generation of AI and data science.

"Few-Shot Learning for Clinical Natural Language Processing Using Siamese
  Neural Networks","  Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become an emerging technology
in healthcare that leverages a large amount of free-text data in electronic
health records (EHRs) to improve patient care, support clinical decisions, and
facilitate clinical and translational science research. Recently, deep learning
has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many clinical NLP tasks. However,
training deep learning models usually requires large annotated datasets, which
are normally not publicly available and can be time-consuming to build in
clinical domains. Working with smaller annotated datasets is typical in
clinical NLP and therefore, ensuring that deep learning models perform well is
crucial for the models to be used in real-world applications. A widely adopted
approach is fine-tuning existing Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), but these
attempts fall short when the training dataset contains only a few annotated
samples. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has recently been investigated to tackle this
problem. Siamese Neural Network (SNN) has been widely utilized as an FSL
approach in computer vision, but has not been studied well in NLP. Furthermore,
the literature on its applications in clinical domains is scarce. In this
paper, we propose two SNN-based FSL approaches for clinical NLP, including
Pre-Trained SNN (PT-SNN) and SNN with Second-Order Embeddings (SOE-SNN). We
evaluated the proposed approaches on two clinical tasks, namely clinical text
classification and clinical named entity recognition. We tested three few-shot
settings including 4-shot, 8-shot, and 16-shot learning. Both clinical NLP
tasks were benchmarked using three PLMs, including BERT,BioBERT, and
BioClinicalBERT. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the
proposed SNN-based FSL approaches in both NLP tasks.

"Semi-Supervised Neural Text Generation by Joint Learning of Natural
  Language Generation and Natural Language Understanding Models","  In Natural Language Generation (NLG), End-to-End (E2E) systems trained

need a large amount of carefully annotated data to reach satisfactory
performance. However, acquiring such datasets for every new NLG application is
a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised

when available. It uses an NLG and a Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
sequence-to-sequence models which are learned jointly to compensate for the
lack of annotation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that, with
limited amount of annotated data, the method can achieve very competitive
results while not using any pre-processing or re-scoring tricks. These findings
open the way to the exploitation of non-annotated datasets which is the current
bottleneck for the E2E NLG system development to new applications.

Opening the black box of language acquisition,"  Recent advances in large language models using deep learning techniques have
renewed interest on how languages can be learned from data. However, it is
unclear whether or how these models represent grammatical information from the
learned languages. In addition, the models must be pre-trained on large corpora
before they can be used. In this work, we propose an alternative, more
transparent and cognitively plausible architecture for learning language.
Instead of using deep learning, our approach uses a minimal cognitive
architecture based on sequence memory and chunking. The learning mechanism is
based on the principles of reinforcement learning. We test our architecture on
a number of natural-like toy languages. Results show that the model can learn
these artificial languages from scratch and extract grammatical information
that supports learning. Our study demonstrates the power of this simple
architecture and stresses the importance of sequence memory as a key component
of the language learning process. Since other animals do not seem to have a
faithful sequence memory, this may explain why only humans have developed
complex languages.

"Evolution of Natural Language Processing Technology: Not Just Language
  Processing Towards General Purpose AI","  Since the invention of computers, communication through natural language
(actual human language) has been a dream technology. However, natural language
is extremely difficult to mathematically formulate, making it difficult to
realize as an algorithm without considering programming. While there have been
numerous technological developments, one cannot say that any results allowing
free utilization have been achieved thus far. In the case of language learning
in humans, for instance when learning one's mother tongue or foreign language,
one must admit that this process is similar to the adage ""practice makes
perfect"" in principle, even though the learning method is significant up to a
point. Deep learning has played a central role in contemporary AI technology in
recent years. When applied to natural language processing (NLP), this produced
unprecedented results. Achievements exceeding the initial predictions have been
reported from the results of learning vast amounts of textual data using deep
learning. For instance, four arithmetic operations could be performed without
explicit learning, thereby enabling the explanation of complex images and the
generation of images from corresponding explanatory texts. It is an accurate
example of the learner embodying the concept of ""practice makes perfect"" by
using vast amounts of textual data. This report provides a technological
explanation of how cutting-edge NLP has made it possible to realize the
""practice makes perfect"" principle. Additionally, examples of how this can be

extensively manually-tuned, statistical learning methods. Real-world financial
data, characterized by its high dimensionality, sparsity, high noise levels,
and significant imbalance, poses unique challenges for the effective
application of deep neural network models. In this work, we introduce a novel
deep learning risk prediction framework, FinLangNet, which conceptualizes
credit loan trajectories in a structure that mirrors linguistic constructs.
This framework is tailored for credit risk prediction using real-world
financial data, drawing on structural similarities to language by adapting
natural language processing techniques. It particularly emphasizes analyzing
the development and forecastability of mid-term credit histories through
multi-head and sequences of detailed financial events. Our research
demonstrates that FinLangNet surpasses traditional statistical methods in
predicting credit risk and that its integration with these methods enhances
credit overdue prediction models, achieving a significant improvement of over
4.24\% in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric.

Deep Learning for Hindi Text Classification: A Comparison,"  Natural Language Processing (NLP) and especially natural language text
analysis have seen great advances in recent times. Usage of deep learning in
text processing has revolutionized the techniques for text processing and
achieved remarkable results. Different deep learning architectures like CNN,
LSTM, and very recent Transformer have been used to achieve state of the art
results variety on NLP tasks. In this work, we survey a host of deep learning
architectures for text classification tasks. The work is specifically concerned
with the classification of Hindi text. The research in the classification of
morphologically rich and low resource Hindi language written in Devanagari
script has been limited due to the absence of large labeled corpus. In this
work, we used translated versions of English data-sets to evaluate models based
on CNN, LSTM and Attention. Multilingual pre-trained sentence embeddings based
on BERT and LASER are also compared to evaluate their effectiveness for the
Hindi language. The paper also serves as a tutorial for popular text
classification techniques.

"Prediction Algorithm for Heat Demand of Science and Technology Topics

technology is not only widely used in the field of natural language processing,
but also more mature in the field of numerical prediction. It is of great
significance for the subject heat prediction and analysis of science and

In this paper, a prediction method of subject heat of science and technology

"A Data-Driven Study of Commonsense Knowledge using the ConceptNet
  Knowledge Base","  Acquiring commonsense knowledge and reasoning is recognized as an important
frontier in achieving general Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent research in
the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has demonstrated significant
progress in this problem setting. Despite this progress, which is mainly on
multiple-choice question answering tasks in limited settings, there is still a
lack of understanding (especially at scale) of the nature of commonsense
knowledge itself. In this paper, we propose and conduct a systematic study to
enable a deeper understanding of commonsense knowledge by doing an empirical
and structural analysis of the ConceptNet knowledge base. ConceptNet is a
freely available knowledge base containing millions of commonsense assertions
presented in natural language. Detailed experimental results on three carefully
designed research questions, using state-of-the-art unsupervised graph
representation learning ('embedding') and clustering techniques, reveal deep
substructures in ConceptNet relations, allowing us to make data-driven and
computational claims about the meaning of phenomena such as 'context' that are
traditionally discussed only in qualitative terms. Furthermore, our methodology
provides a case study in how to use data-science and computational
methodologies for understanding the nature of an everyday (yet complex)
psychological phenomenon that is an essential feature of human intelligence.

"Surveying the Landscape of Text Summarization with Deep Learning: A
  Comprehensive Review","  In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized natural language processing
(NLP) by enabling the development of models that can learn complex
representations of language data, leading to significant improvements in
performance across a wide range of NLP tasks. Deep learning models for NLP
typically use large amounts of data to train deep neural networks, allowing
them to learn the patterns and relationships in language data. This is in
contrast to traditional NLP approaches, which rely on hand-engineered features
and rules to perform NLP tasks. The ability of deep neural networks to learn
hierarchical representations of language data, handle variable-length input
sequences, and perform well on large datasets makes them well-suited for NLP
applications. Driven by the exponential growth of textual data and the
increasing demand for condensed, coherent, and informative summaries, text
summarization has been a critical research area in the field of NLP. Applying
deep learning to text summarization refers to the use of deep neural networks
to perform text summarization tasks. In this survey, we begin with a review of
fashionable text summarization tasks in recent years, including extractive,
abstractive, multi-document, and so on. Next, we discuss most deep
learning-based models and their experimental results on these tasks. The paper
also covers datasets and data representation for summarization tasks. Finally,
we delve into the opportunities and challenges associated with summarization
tasks and their corresponding methodologies, aiming to inspire future research
efforts to advance the field further. A goal of our survey is to explain how
these methods differ in their requirements as understanding them is essential
for choosing a technique suited for a specific setting.

Do learned speech symbols follow Zipf's law?,"  In this study, we investigate whether speech symbols, learned through deep
learning, follow Zipf's law, akin to natural language symbols. Zipf's law is an
empirical law that delineates the frequency distribution of words, forming
fundamentals for statistical analysis in natural language processing. Natural
language symbols, which are invented by humans to symbolize speech content, are
recognized to comply with this law. On the other hand, recent breakthroughs in
spoken language processing have given rise to the development of learned speech
symbols; these are data-driven symbolizations of speech content. Our objective
is to ascertain whether these data-driven speech symbols follow Zipf's law, as
the same as natural language symbols. Through our investigation, we aim to
forge new ways for the statistical analysis of spoken language processing.

"A Comprehensive Python Library for Deep Learning-Based Event Detection
  in Multivariate Time Series Data and Information Retrieval in NLP","  Event detection in time series data is crucial in various domains, including
finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and science. Accurately identifying events
in time series data is vital for making informed decisions, detecting
anomalies, and predicting future trends. Despite extensive research exploring
diverse methods for event detection in time series, with deep learning
approaches being among the most advanced, there is still room for improvement
and innovation in this field. In this paper, we present a new deep learning
supervised method for detecting events in multivariate time series data. Our
method combines four distinct novelties compared to existing deep-learning
supervised methods. Firstly, it is based on regression instead of binary
classification. Secondly, it does not require labeled datasets where each point
is labeled; instead, it only requires reference events defined as time points
or intervals of time. Thirdly, it is designed to be robust by using a stacked
ensemble learning meta-model that combines deep learning models, ranging from
classic feed-forward neural networks (FFNs) to state-of-the-art architectures
like transformers. This ensemble approach can mitigate individual model
weaknesses and biases, resulting in more robust predictions. Finally, to
facilitate practical implementation, we have developed a Python package to
accompany our proposed method. The package, called eventdetector-ts, can be
installed through the Python Package Index (PyPI). In this paper, we present
our method and provide a comprehensive guide on the usage of the package. We
showcase its versatility and effectiveness through different real-world use
cases from natural language processing (NLP) to financial security domains.

Deep Learning Works in Practice. But Does it Work in Theory?,"  Deep learning relies on a very specific kind of neural networks: those
superposing several neural layers. In the last few years, deep learning
achieved major breakthroughs in many tasks such as image analysis, speech
recognition, natural language processing, and so on. Yet, there is no
theoretical explanation of this success. In particular, it is not clear why the
deeper the network, the better it actually performs.
  We argue that the explanation is intimately connected to a key feature of the
data collected from our surrounding universe to feed the machine learning
algorithms: large non-parallelizable logical depth. Roughly speaking, we
conjecture that the shortest computational descriptions of the universe are
algorithms with inherently large computation times, even when a large number of
computers are available for parallelization. Interestingly, this conjecture,
combined with the folklore conjecture in theoretical computer science that $ P
\neq NC$, explains the success of deep learning.

Identifying and Exploiting Structures for Reliable Deep Learning,"  Deep learning research has recently witnessed an impressively fast-paced
progress in a wide range of tasks including computer vision, natural language
processing, and reinforcement learning. The extraordinary performance of these
systems often gives the impression that they can be used to revolutionise our
lives for the better. However, as recent works point out, these systems suffer
from several issues that make them unreliable for use in the real world,
including vulnerability to adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al. [248]), tendency
to memorise noise (Zhang et al. [292]), being over-confident on incorrect
predictions (miscalibration) (Guo et al. [99]), and unsuitability for handling
private data (Gilad-Bachrach et al. [88]). In this thesis, we look at each of
these issues in detail, investigate their causes, and propose computationally
cheap algorithms for mitigating them in practice. To do this, we identify
structures in deep neural networks that can be exploited to mitigate the above
causes of unreliability of deep learning algorithms.

Text Classification: A Perspective of Deep Learning Methods,"  In recent years, with the rapid development of information on the Internet,
the number of complex texts and documents has increased exponentially, which
requires a deeper understanding of deep learning methods in order to accurately
classify texts using deep learning techniques, and thus deep learning methods
have become increasingly important in text classification. Text classification
is a class of tasks that automatically classifies a set of documents into
multiple predefined categories based on their content and subject matter. Thus,
the main goal of text classification is to enable users to extract information
from textual resources and process processes such as retrieval, classification,
and machine learning techniques together in order to classify different
categories. Many new techniques of deep learning have already achieved
excellent results in natural language processing. The success of these learning
algorithms relies on their ability to understand complex models and non-linear
relationships in data. However, finding the right structure, architecture, and
techniques for text classification is a challenge for researchers. This paper
introduces deep learning-based text classification algorithms, including
important steps required for text classification tasks such as feature
extraction, feature reduction, and evaluation strategies and methods. At the
end of the article, different deep learning text classification methods are

"Application of Transfer Learning to Sign Language Recognition using an
  Inflated 3D Deep Convolutional Neural Network","  Sign language is the primary language for people with a hearing loss. Sign
language recognition (SLR) is the automatic recognition of sign language, which
represents a challenging problem for computers, though some progress has been
made recently using deep learning. Huge amounts of data are generally required
to train deep learning models. However, corresponding datasets are missing for
the majority of sign languages. Transfer learning is a technique to utilize a
related task with an abundance of data available to help solve a target task
lacking sufficient data. Transfer learning has been applied highly successfully
in computer vision and natural language processing. However, much less research
has been conducted in the field of SLR. This paper investigates how effectively
transfer learning can be applied to isolated SLR using an inflated 3D
convolutional neural network as the deep learning architecture. Transfer
learning is implemented by pre-training a network on the American Sign Language
dataset MS-ASL and subsequently fine-tuning it separately on three different
sizes of the German Sign Language dataset SIGNUM. The results of the
experiments give clear empirical evidence that transfer learning can be
effectively applied to isolated SLR. The accuracy performances of the networks
applying transfer learning increased substantially by up to 21% as compared to
the baseline models that were not pre-trained on the MS-ASL dataset.

Three-Class Text Sentiment Analysis Based on LSTM,"  Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP)
with applications in public opinion monitoring, market research, and beyond.
This paper introduces a three-class sentiment classification method for Weibo
comments using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to discern positive,
neutral, and negative sentiments. LSTM, as a deep learning model, excels at
capturing long-distance dependencies in text data, providing significant
advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. Through preprocessing
and feature extraction from Weibo comment texts, our LSTM model achieves
precise sentiment prediction. Experimental results demonstrate superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 98.31% and an F1 score of 98.28%, notably
outperforming conventional models and other deep learning methods. This
underscores the effectiveness of LSTM in capturing nuanced sentiment
information within text, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. Despite its
strengths, the LSTM model faces challenges such as high computational
complexity and slower processing times for lengthy texts. Moreover, complex
emotional expressions like sarcasm and humor pose additional difficulties.
Future work could explore combining pre-trained models or advancing feature
engineering techniques to further improve both accuracy and practicality.
Overall, this study provides an effective solution for sentiment analysis on
Weibo comments.

Geometric deep learning: going beyond Euclidean data,"  Many scientific fields study data with an underlying structure that is a

neural networks, which have recently proven to be powerful tools for a broad
range of problems from computer vision, natural language processing, and audio
analysis. However, these tools have been most successful on data with an
underlying Euclidean or grid-like structure, and in cases where the invariances
of these structures are built into networks used to model them. Geometric deep

"Large Language Models are not Models of Natural Language: they are
  Corpus Models","  Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become one of the leading application
areas in the current Artificial Intelligence boom. Transfer learning has
enabled large deep learning neural networks trained on the language modeling
task to vastly improve performance in almost all downstream language tasks.
Interestingly, when the language models are trained with data that includes
software code, they demonstrate remarkable abilities in generating functioning
computer code from natural language specifications. We argue that this creates
a conundrum for the claim that eliminative neural models are a radical
restructuring in our understanding of cognition in that they eliminate the need
for symbolic abstractions like generative phrase structure grammars. Because
the syntax of programming languages is by design determined by phrase structure
grammars, neural models that produce syntactic code are apparently
uninformative about the theoretical foundations of programming languages. The
demonstration that neural models perform well on tasks that involve clearly
symbolic systems, proves that they cannot be used as an argument that language
and other cognitive systems are not symbolic. Finally, we argue as a corollary
that the term language model is misleading and propose the adoption of the
working term corpus model instead, which better reflects the genesis and
contents of the model.

classify attacks and detect new ones. Adversarial learning is the process of
utilizing machine learning to generate a perturbed set of inputs to then feed
to the neural network to misclassify it. Much of the current work in the field
of adversarial learning has been conducted in image processing and natural
language processing with a wide variety of algorithms. Two algorithms of
interest are the Elastic-Net Attack on Deep Neural Networks and TextAttack. In
our experiment the EAD and TextAttack algorithms are applied to a Domain Name
System amplification classifier. The algorithms are used to generate malicious
Distributed Denial of Service adversarial examples to then feed as inputs to
the network intrusion detection systems neural network to classify as valid
traffic. We show in this work that both image processing and natural language
processing adversarial learning algorithms can be applied against a network
intrusion detection neural network.

"Comprehensive Implementation of TextCNN for Enhanced Collaboration
  between Natural Language Processing and System Recommendation","  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial
intelligence that studies how to enable computers to understand, process, and
generate human language. Text classification is a fundamental task in NLP,
which aims to classify text into different predefined categories. Text
classification is the most basic and classic task in natural language
processing, and most of the tasks in natural language processing can be
regarded as classification tasks. In recent years, deep learning has achieved
great success in many research fields, and today, it has also become a standard
technology in the field of NLP, which is widely integrated into text
classification tasks. Unlike numbers and images, text processing emphasizes
fine-grained processing ability. Traditional text classification methods
generally require preprocessing the input model's text data. Additionally, they
also need to obtain good sample features through manual annotation and then use
classical machine learning algorithms for classification. Therefore, this paper
analyzes the application status of deep learning in the three core tasks of NLP
(including text representation, word order modeling, and knowledge
representation). This content explores the improvement and synergy achieved
through natural language processing in the context of text classification,
while also taking into account the challenges posed by adversarial techniques
in text generation, text classification, and semantic parsing. An empirical
study on text classification tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of
interactive integration training, particularly in conjunction with TextCNN,
highlighting the significance of these advancements in text classification
augmentation and enhancement.

Quantifying Uncertainties in Natural Language Processing Tasks,"  Reliable uncertainty quantification is a first step towards building
explainable, transparent, and accountable artificial intelligent systems.
Recent progress in Bayesian deep learning has made such quantification

characterizing model and data uncertainties for natural language processing

recognition, and language modeling using convolutional and recurrent neural
network models, we show that explicitly modeling uncertainties is not only
necessary to measure output confidence levels, but also useful at enhancing
model performances in various NLP tasks.

Sentiment Analysis for Sinhala Language using Deep Learning Techniques,"  Due to the high impact of the fast-evolving fields of machine learning and
deep learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks have further obtained
comprehensive performances for highly resourced languages such as English and
Chinese. However Sinhala, which is an under-resourced language with a rich
morphology, has not experienced these advancements. For sentiment analysis,
there exists only two previous research with deep learning approaches, which
focused only on document-level sentiment analysis for the binary case. They
experimented with only three types of deep learning models. In contrast, this
paper presents a much comprehensive study on the use of standard sequence
models such as RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, as well as more recent state-of-the-art
models such as hierarchical attention hybrid neural networks, and capsule
networks. Classification is done at document-level but with more granularity by
considering POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, and CONFLICT classes. A data set of
15059 Sinhala news comments, annotated with these four classes and a corpus
consists of 9.48 million tokens are publicly released. This is the largest
sentiment annotated data set for Sinhala so far.

"Navigating the Kaleidoscope of COVID-19 Misinformation Using Deep
  Learning","  Irrespective of the success of the deep learning-based mixed-domain transfer
learning approach for solving various Natural Language Processing tasks, it
does not lend a generalizable solution for detecting misinformation from
COVID-19 social media data. Due to the inherent complexity of this type of
data, caused by its dynamic (context evolves rapidly), nuanced (misinformation
types are often ambiguous), and diverse (skewed, fine-grained, and overlapping
categories) nature, it is imperative for an effective model to capture both the
local and global context of the target domain. By conducting a systematic
investigation, we show that: (i) the deep Transformer-based pre-trained models,
utilized via the mixed-domain transfer learning, are only good at capturing the
local context, thus exhibits poor generalization, and (ii) a combination of
shallow network-based domain-specific models and convolutional neural networks
can efficiently extract local as well as global context directly from the
target data in a hierarchical fashion, enabling it to offer a more
generalizable solution.

Knowledge Efficient Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing,"  Deep learning has become the workhorse for a wide range of natural language
processing applications. But much of the success of deep learning relies on
annotated examples. Annotation is time-consuming and expensive to produce at
scale. Here we are interested in methods for reducing the required quantity of
annotated data -- by making the learning methods more knowledge efficient so as
to make them more applicable in low annotation (low resource) settings. There
are various classical approaches to making the models more knowledge efficient
such as multi-task learning, transfer learning, weakly supervised and
unsupervised learning etc. This thesis focuses on adapting such classical
methods to modern deep learning models and algorithms.
  This thesis describes four works aimed at making machine learning models more
knowledge efficient. First, we propose a knowledge rich deep learning model
(KRDL) as a unifying learning framework for incorporating prior knowledge into
deep models. In particular, we apply KRDL built on Markov logic networks to
denoise weak supervision. Second, we apply a KRDL model to assist the machine
reading models to find the correct evidence sentences that can support their
decision. Third, we investigate the knowledge transfer techniques in
multilingual setting, where we proposed a method that can improve pre-trained
multilingual BERT based on the bilingual dictionary. Fourth, we present an
episodic memory network for language modelling, in which we encode the large
external knowledge for the pre-trained GPT.

"Hierarchical Representation in Neural Language Models: Suppression and
  Recovery of Expectations","  Deep learning sequence models have led to a marked increase in performance
for a range of Natural Language Processing tasks, but it remains an open
question whether they are able to induce proper hierarchical generalizations
for representing natural language from linear input alone. Work using
artificial languages as training input has shown that LSTMs are capable of
inducing the stack-like data structures required to represent context-free and
certain mildly context-sensitive languages---formal language classes which
correspond in theory to the hierarchical structures of natural language. Here
we present a suite of experiments probing whether neural language models
trained on linguistic data induce these stack-like data structures and deploy
them while incrementally predicting words. We study two natural language
phenomena: center embedding sentences and syntactic island constraints on the
filler--gap dependency. In order to properly predict words in these structures,
a model must be able to temporarily suppress certain expectations and then
recover those expectations later, essentially pushing and popping these
expectations on a stack. Our results provide evidence that models can
successfully suppress and recover expectations in many cases, but do not fully
recover their previous grammatical state.

"DeCLUTR: Deep Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Textual
  Representations","  Sentence embeddings are an important component of many natural language
processing (NLP) systems. Like word embeddings, sentence embeddings are
typically learned on large text corpora and then transferred to various
downstream tasks, such as clustering and retrieval. Unlike word embeddings, the
highest performing solutions for learning sentence embeddings require labelled
data, limiting their usefulness to languages and domains where labelled data is
abundant. In this paper, we present DeCLUTR: Deep Contrastive Learning for
Unsupervised Textual Representations. Inspired by recent advances in deep
metric learning (DML), we carefully design a self-supervised objective for
learning universal sentence embeddings that does not require labelled training
data. When used to extend the pretraining of transformer-based language models,
our approach closes the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised
pretraining for universal sentence encoders. Importantly, our experiments
suggest that the quality of the learned embeddings scale with both the number
of trainable parameters and the amount of unlabelled training data. Our code
and pretrained models are publicly available and can be easily adapted to new
domains or used to embed unseen text.

Towards Explainable Fact Checking,"  The past decade has seen a substantial rise in the amount of mis- and
disinformation online, from targeted disinformation campaigns to influence
politics, to the unintentional spreading of misinformation about public health.
This development has spurred research in the area of automatic fact checking,
from approaches to detect check-worthy claims and determining the stance of
tweets towards claims, to methods to determine the veracity of claims given
evidence documents. These automatic methods are often content-based, using
natural language processing methods, which in turn utilise deep neural networks
to learn higher-order features from text in order to make predictions. As deep
neural networks are black-box models, their inner workings cannot be easily
explained. At the same time, it is desirable to explain how they arrive at
certain decisions, especially if they are to be used for decision making. While
this has been known for some time, the issues this raises have been exacerbated
by models increasing in size, and by EU legislation requiring models to be used
for decision making to provide explanations, and, very recently, by legislation
requiring online platforms operating in the EU to provide transparent reporting
on their services. Despite this, current solutions for explainability are still
lacking in the area of fact checking. This thesis presents my research on
automatic fact checking, including claim check-worthiness detection, stance
detection and veracity prediction. Its contributions go beyond fact checking,
with the thesis proposing more general machine learning solutions for natural
language processing in the area of learning with limited labelled data.
Finally, the thesis presents some first solutions for explainable fact
checking.

Geometric deep learning on graphs and manifolds using mixture model CNNs,"  Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several
fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and
computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN)
architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of
image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep
learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D
Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos.
Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning,
attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data
such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains
of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In
this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN
architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local,
stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various
non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be
considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed
method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph- and 3D shape
analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.

massive amounts of data for effective analysis and processing, much like data
volume. To handle the challenge of compiling huge amounts of medical,

"Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality in Deep Neural Networks by Learning
  Invariant Representations","  Artificial intelligence, particularly the subfield of machine learning, has
seen a paradigm shift towards data-driven models that learn from and adapt to
data. This has resulted in unprecedented advancements in various domains such
as natural language processing and computer vision, largely attributed to deep
learning, a special class of machine learning models. Deep learning arguably
surpasses traditional approaches by learning the relevant features from raw
data through a series of computational layers.
  This thesis explores the theoretical foundations of deep learning by studying
the relationship between the architecture of these models and the inherent
structures found within the data they process. In particular, we ask What
drives the efficacy of deep learning algorithms and allows them to beat the
so-called curse of dimensionality-i.e. the difficulty of generally learning
functions in high dimensions due to the exponentially increasing need for data
points with increased dimensionality? Is it their ability to learn relevant
representations of the data by exploiting their structure? How do different
architectures exploit different data structures? In order to address these
questions, we push forward the idea that the structure of the data can be
effectively characterized by its invariances-i.e. aspects that are irrelevant
for the task at hand.
  Our methodology takes an empirical approach to deep learning, combining
experimental studies with physics-inspired toy models. These simplified models
allow us to investigate and interpret the complex behaviors we observe in deep
learning systems, offering insights into their inner workings, with the
far-reaching goal of bridging the gap between theory and practice.

Semantic Labeling Using a Deep Contextualized Language Model,"  Generating schema labels automatically for column values of data tables has

"Learning beyond datasets: Knowledge Graph Augmented Neural Networks for

but learning is still heavily dependent on the specific training data. Some
learning models can be incorporated with a prior knowledge in the Bayesian set
up, but these learning models do not have the ability to access any organised

with world knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph (KG) fact triples for
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Our aim is to develop a deep learning
model that can extract relevant prior support facts from knowledge graphs
depending on the task using attention mechanism. We introduce a
convolution-based model for learning representations of knowledge graph entity
and relation clusters in order to reduce the attention space. We show that the
proposed method is highly scalable to the amount of prior information that has
to be processed and can be applied to any generic NLP task. Using this method
we show significant improvement in performance for text classification with
News20, DBPedia datasets and natural language inference with Stanford Natural

a major impact on academic research and industry. Nowadays, DL provides an
unprecedented way to analyze and process data with demonstrated great results

"Deep Bayesian Active Learning for Natural Language Processing: Results
  of a Large-Scale Empirical Study","  Several recent papers investigate Active Learning (AL) for mitigating the
data dependence of deep learning for natural language processing. However, the
applicability of AL to real-world problems remains an open question. While in
supervised learning, practitioners can try many different methods, evaluating
each against a validation set before selecting a model, AL affords no such
luxury. Over the course of one AL run, an agent annotates its dataset
exhausting its labeling budget. Thus, given a new task, an active learner has
no opportunity to compare models and acquisition functions. This paper provides
a large scale empirical study of deep active learning, addressing multiple
tasks and, for each, multiple datasets, multiple models, and a full suite of
acquisition functions. We find that across all settings, Bayesian active
learning by disagreement, using uncertainty estimates provided either by
Dropout or Bayes-by Backprop significantly improves over i.i.d. baselines and
usually outperforms classic uncertainty sampling.

Generalization Error in Deep Learning,"  Deep learning models have lately shown great performance in various fields
such as computer vision, speech recognition, speech translation, and natural
language processing. However, alongside their state-of-the-art performance, it
is still generally unclear what is the source of their generalization ability.
Thus, an important question is what makes deep neural networks able to
generalize well from the training set to new data. In this article, we provide
an overview of the existing theory and bounds for the characterization of the
generalization error of deep neural networks, combining both classical and more
recent theoretical and empirical results.

"An exact mapping between the Variational Renormalization Group and Deep
  Learning","  Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of
representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from
structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results
on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech
recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of
deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these
techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show
that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and
successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG).
RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of
relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at
different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational
renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning
architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate
these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions.
Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a
generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.

"Attention versus Contrastive Learning of Tabular Data -- A Data-centric
  Benchmarking","  Despite groundbreaking success in image and text learning, deep learning has
not achieved significant improvements against traditional machine learning (ML)
when it comes to tabular data. This performance gap underscores the need for
data-centric treatment and benchmarking of learning algorithms. Recently,
attention and contrastive learning breakthroughs have shifted computer vision
and natural language processing paradigms. However, the effectiveness of these
advanced deep models on tabular data is sparsely studied using a few data sets
with very large sample sizes, reporting mixed findings after benchmarking
against a limited number of baselines. We argue that the heterogeneity of
tabular data sets and selective baselines in the literature can bias the
benchmarking outcomes. This article extensively evaluates state-of-the-art
attention and contrastive learning methods on a wide selection of 28 tabular
data sets (14 easy and 14 hard-to-classify) against traditional deep and
machine learning. Our data-centric benchmarking demonstrates when traditional
ML is preferred over deep learning and vice versa because no best learning
method exists for all tabular data sets. Combining between-sample and
between-feature attentions conquers the invincible traditional ML on tabular
data sets by a significant margin but fails on high dimensional data, where
contrastive learning takes a robust lead. While a hybrid attention-contrastive
learning strategy mostly wins on hard-to-classify data sets, traditional
methods are frequently superior on easy-to-classify data sets with presumably
simpler decision boundaries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
benchmarking paper with statistical analyses of attention and contrastive
learning performances on a diverse selection of tabular data sets against
traditional deep and machine learning baselines to facilitate further advances
in this field.

Contextual Text Denoising with Masked Language Models,"  Recently, with the help of deep learning models, significant advances have

model. The proposed algorithm does not require retraining of the model and can
be integrated into any NLP system without additional training on paired
cleaning training data. We evaluate our method under synthetic noise and
natural noise and show that the proposed algorithm can use context information
to correct noise text and improve the performance of noisy inputs in several
downstream tasks.

Deep learning systems as complex networks,"  Thanks to the availability of large scale digital datasets and massive
amounts of computational power, deep learning algorithms can learn
representations of data by exploiting multiple levels of abstraction. These
machine learning methods have greatly improved the state-of-the-art in many
challenging cognitive tasks, such as visual object recognition, speech
processing, natural language understanding and automatic translation. In
particular, one class of deep learning models, known as deep belief networks,
can discover intricate statistical structure in large data sets in a completely
unsupervised fashion, by learning a generative model of the data using
Hebbian-like learning mechanisms. Although these self-organizing systems can be
conveniently formalized within the framework of statistical mechanics, their
internal functioning remains opaque, because their emergent dynamics cannot be
solved analytically. In this article we propose to study deep belief networks
using techniques commonly employed in the study of complex networks, in order
to gain some insights into the structural and functional properties of the
computational graph resulting from the learning process.

"A Hybrid Approach to Dependency Parsing: Combining Rules and Morphology
  with Deep Learning","  Fully data-driven, deep learning-based models are usually designed as
language-independent and have been shown to be successful for many natural
language processing tasks. However, when the studied language is low-resourced
and the amount of training data is insufficient, these models can benefit from
the integration of natural language grammar-based information. We propose two
approaches to dependency parsing especially for languages with restricted
amount of training data. Our first approach combines a state-of-the-art deep
learning-based parser with a rule-based approach and the second one
incorporates morphological information into the parser. In the rule-based
approach, the parsing decisions made by the rules are encoded and concatenated
with the vector representations of the input words as additional information to
the deep network. The morphology-based approach proposes different methods to
include the morphological structure of words into the parser network.
Experiments are conducted on the IMST-UD Treebank and the results suggest that
integration of explicit knowledge about the target language to a neural parser
through a rule-based parsing system and morphological analysis leads to more
accurate annotations and hence, increases the parsing performance in terms of
attachment scores. The proposed methods are developed for Turkish, but can be
adapted to other languages as well.

"Exploring transfer learning for Deep NLP systems on rarely annotated
  languages","  Natural language processing (NLP) has experienced rapid advancements with the
rise of deep learning, significantly outperforming traditional rule-based
methods. By capturing hidden patterns and underlying structures within data,
deep learning has improved performance across various NLP tasks, overcoming the
limitations of rule-based systems. However, most research and development in
NLP has been concentrated on a select few languages, primarily those with large
numbers of speakers or financial significance, leaving many others
underexplored. This lack of research is often attributed to the scarcity of
adequately annotated datasets essential for training deep learning models.
Despite this challenge, there is potential in leveraging the linguistic
similarities between unexplored and well-studied languages, particularly those
in close geographic and linguistic proximity. This thesis investigates the
application of transfer learning for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging between Hindi
and Nepali, two highly similar languages belonging to the Indo-Aryan language
family. Specifically, the work explores whether joint training of a POS tagging
model for both languages enhances performance. Additionally, we assess whether
multitask learning in Hindi, with auxiliary tasks such as gender and
singular/plural tagging, can contribute to improved POS tagging accuracy. The
deep learning architecture employed is the BLSTM-CNN-CRF model, trained under
different conditions: monolingual word embeddings, vector-mapped embeddings,
and jointly trained Hindi-Nepali word embeddings. Varying dropout rates (0.25
to 0.5) and optimizers (ADAM and AdaDelta) are also evaluated. Results indicate
that jointly trained Hindi-Nepali word embeddings improve performance across
all models compared to monolingual and vector-mapped embeddings.

features from different domains to be embedded in the same space and a future
prediction module that learns temporal information. SBnet has been trained
using the CityFlow-NL dataset that contains 2,498 tracks of vehicles with three
unique natural language descriptions each and tested 530 unique vehicle tracks
and their corresponding query sets. SBNet achieved a significant improvement
over the baseline in the natural language-based vehicle tracking track in the

multiple languages and the mutual transfer of knowledge acquired in each of
them. Both classical feature extractors, such as Term frequency-inverse
document frequency or Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and integrated deep NLP

employed. The results of experiments conducted on two datasets dedicated to the
fake news classification task (in English and Spanish, respectively), supported
by statistical analysis, confirmed that utilization of additional languages
could improve performance for traditional methods. Also, in some cases
supplementing the deep learning method with classical ones can positively
impact obtained results. The ability of models to generalize the knowledge
acquired between the analyzed languages was also observed.

"Explaining the Deep Natural Language Processing by Mining Textual
  Interpretable Features","  Despite the high accuracy offered by state-of-the-art deep natural-language
models (e.g. LSTM, BERT), their application in real-life settings is still
widely limited, as they behave like a black-box to the end-user. Hence,
explainability is rapidly becoming a fundamental requirement of
future-generation data-driven systems based on deep-learning approaches.
Several attempts to fulfill the existing gap between accuracy and
interpretability have been done. However, robust and specialized xAI
(Explainable Artificial Intelligence) solutions tailored to deep
natural-language models are still missing. We propose a new framework, named
T-EBAnO, which provides innovative prediction-local and class-based
model-global explanation strategies tailored to black-box deep natural-language
models. Given a deep NLP model and the textual input data, T-EBAnO provides an
objective, human-readable, domain-specific assessment of the reasons behind the
automatic decision-making process. Specifically, the framework extracts sets of
interpretable features mining the inner knowledge of the model. Then, it
quantifies the influence of each feature during the prediction process by
exploiting the novel normalized Perturbation Influence Relation index at the
local level and the novel Global Absolute Influence and Global Relative
Influence indexes at the global level. The effectiveness and the quality of the
local and global explanations obtained with T-EBAnO are proved on (i) a

assumptions (e.g., linearity, stationarity, and homoscedasticity) that are
implausible for many natural systems and may critically affect the
interpretation of data. We evaluate our model on incremental human language
processing, a domain with complex continuous dynamics. We demonstrate
substantial improvements on behavioral and neuroimaging data, and we show that

for diverse confounds in confirmatory analyses, and opens up research questions

a vital role in data processing and analytics where many algorithm designs have
incorporated heuristics and general rules from human knowledge and experience
to improve their effectiveness. Recently, reinforcement learning, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) in particular, is increasingly explored and
exploited in many areas because it can learn better strategies in complicated
environments it is interacting with than statically designed algorithms.
Motivated by this trend, we provide a comprehensive review of recent works
focusing on utilizing DRL to improve data processing and analytics. First, we
present an introduction to key concepts, theories, and methods in DRL. Next, we
discuss DRL deployment on database systems, facilitating data processing and
analytics in various aspects, including data organization, scheduling, tuning,
and indexing. Then, we survey the application of DRL in data processing and
analytics, ranging from data preparation, natural language processing to
healthcare, fintech, etc. Finally, we discuss important open challenges and
future research directions of using DRL in data processing and analytics.

"Case Studies on using Natural Language Processing Techniques in Customer
  Relationship Management Software","  How can a text corpus stored in a customer relationship management (CRM)
database be used for data mining and segmentation? In order to answer this
question we inherited the state of the art methods commonly used in natural
language processing (NLP) literature, such as word embeddings, and deep
learning literature, such as recurrent neural networks (RNN). We used the text
notes from a CRM system which are taken by customer representatives of an
internet ads consultancy agency between years 2009 and 2020. We trained word
embeddings by using the corresponding text corpus and showed that these word
embeddings can not only be used directly for data mining but also be used in
RNN architectures, which are deep learning frameworks built with long short
term memory (LSTM) units, for more comprehensive segmentation objectives. The
results prove that structured text data in a CRM can be used to mine out very
valuable information and any CRM can be equipped with useful NLP features once
the problem definitions are properly built and the solution methods are
conveniently implemented.

"From the digital data revolution to digital health and digital economy
  toward a digital society: Pervasiveness of Artificial Intelligence","  Technological progress has led to powerful computers and communication
technologies that penetrate nowadays all areas of science, industry and our
private lives. As a consequence, all these areas are generating digital traces
of data amounting to big data resources. This opens unprecedented opportunities
but also challenges toward the analysis, management, interpretation and
utilization of these data. Fortunately, recent breakthroughs in deep learning
algorithms complement now machine learning and statistics methods for an
efficient analysis of such data. Furthermore, advances in text mining and
natural language processing, e.g., word-embedding methods, enable also the
processing of large amounts of text data from diverse sources as governmental
reports, blog entries in social media or clinical health records of patients.
In this paper, we present a perspective on the role of artificial intelligence
in these developments and discuss also potential problems we are facing in a

"What Averages Do Not Tell -- Predicting Real Life Processes with
  Sequential Deep Learning","  Deep Learning is proven to be an effective tool for modeling sequential data
as shown by the success in Natural Language, Computer Vision and Signal
Processing. Process Mining concerns discovering insights on business processes
from their execution data that are logged by supporting information systems.
The logged data (event log) is formed of event sequences (traces) that
correspond to executions of a process. Many Deep Learning techniques have been
successfully adapted for predictive Process Mining that aims to predict process
outcomes, remaining time, the next event, or even the suffix of running traces.
Traces in Process Mining are multimodal sequences and very differently
structured than natural language sentences or images. This may require a
different approach to processing. So far, there has been little focus on these
differences and the challenges introduced. Looking at suffix prediction as the
most challenging of these tasks, the performance of Deep Learning models was
evaluated only on average measures and for a small number of real-life event
logs. Comparing the results between papers is difficult due to different
pre-processing and evaluation strategies. Challenges that may be relevant are
the skewness of trace-length distribution and the skewness of the activity
distribution in real-life event logs. We provide an end-to-end framework which
enables to compare the performance of seven state-of-the-art sequential
architectures in common settings. Results show that sequence modeling still has
a lot of room for improvement for majority of the more complex datasets.
Further research and insights are required to get consistent performance not
just in average measures but additionally over all the prefixes.

Phonology Recognition in American Sign Language,"  Inspired by recent developments in natural language processing, we propose a
novel approach to sign language processing based on phonological properties
validated by American Sign Language users. By taking advantage of datasets
composed of phonological data and people speaking sign language, we use a
pretrained deep model based on mesh reconstruction to extract the 3D
coordinates of the signers keypoints. Then, we train standard statistical and
deep machine learning models in order to assign phonological classes to each
temporal sequence of coordinates.
  Our paper introduces the idea of exploiting the phonological properties
manually assigned by sign language users to classify videos of people
performing signs by regressing a 3D mesh. We establish a new baseline for this
problem based on the statistical distribution of 725 different signs. Our
best-performing models achieve a micro-averaged F1-score of 58% for the major
location class and 70% for the sign type using statistical and deep learning
algorithms, compared to their corresponding baselines of 35% and 39%.

Transfer Learning Between Related Tasks Using Expected Label Proportions,"  Deep learning systems thrive on abundance of labeled training data but such
data is not always available, calling for alternative methods of supervision.
One such method is expectation regularization (XR) (Mann and McCallum, 2007),
where models are trained based on expected label proportions. We propose a
novel application of the XR framework for transfer learning between related
tasks, where knowing the labels of task A provides an estimation of the label
proportion of task B. We then use a model trained for A to label a large
corpus, and use this corpus with an XR loss to train a model for task B. To
make the XR framework applicable to large-scale deep-learning setups, we
propose a stochastic batched approximation procedure. We demonstrate the
approach on the task of Aspect-based Sentiment classification, where we
effectively use a sentence-level sentiment predictor to train accurate
aspect-based predictor. The method improves upon fully supervised neural system
trained on aspect-level data, and is also cumulative with LM-based pretraining,
as we demonstrate by improving a BERT-based Aspect-based Sentiment model.

Meta-Reinforcement Learning via Language Instructions,"  Although deep reinforcement learning has recently been very successful at
learning complex behaviors, it requires a tremendous amount of data to learn a
task. One of the fundamental reasons causing this limitation lies in the nature
of the trial-and-error learning paradigm of reinforcement learning, where the
agent communicates with the environment and progresses in the learning only
relying on the reward signal. This is implicit and rather insufficient to learn
a task well. On the contrary, humans are usually taught new skills via natural
language instructions. Utilizing language instructions for robotic motion
control to improve the adaptability is a recently emerged topic and
challenging. In this paper, we present a meta-RL algorithm that addresses the
challenge of learning skills with language instructions in multiple
manipulation tasks. On the one hand, our algorithm utilizes the language
instructions to shape its interpretation of the task, on the other hand, it
still learns to solve task in a trial-and-error process. We evaluate our
algorithm on the robotic manipulation benchmark (Meta-World) and it
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training and
testing task success rates. Codes are available at

"Privacy-Preserving Serverless Edge Learning with Decentralized Small
  Data","  In the last decade, data-driven algorithms outperformed traditional
optimization-based algorithms in many research areas, such as computer vision,
natural language processing, etc. However, extensive data usages bring a new
challenge or even threat to deep learning algorithms, i.e., privacy-preserving.
Distributed training strategies have recently become a promising approach to
ensure data privacy when training deep models. This paper extends conventional
serverless platforms with serverless edge learning architectures and provides
an efficient distributed training framework from the networking perspective.
This framework dynamically orchestrates available resources among heterogeneous
physical units to efficiently fulfill deep learning objectives. The design
jointly considers learning task requests and underlying infrastructure
heterogeneity, including last-mile transmissions, computation abilities of
mobile devices, edge and cloud computing centers, and devices battery status.
Furthermore, to significantly reduce distributed training overheads,
small-scale data training is proposed by integrating with a general, simple
data classifier. This low-load enhancement can seamlessly work with various
distributed deep models to improve communications and computation efficiencies
during the training phase. Finally, open challenges and future research
directions encourage the research community to develop efficient distributed
deep learning techniques.

"Lessons Learned from a Citizen Science Project for Natural Language

training and evaluation. However, labeled data is often costly to obtain and
scaling annotation projects is difficult, which is why annotation tasks are
often outsourced to paid crowdworkers. Citizen Science is an alternative to
crowdsourcing that is relatively unexplored in the context of NLP. To
investigate whether and how well Citizen Science can be applied in this
setting, we conduct an exploratory study into engaging different groups of
volunteers in Citizen Science for NLP by re-annotating parts of a pre-existing
crowdsourced dataset. Our results show that this can yield high-quality

WikiBERT models: deep transfer learning for many languages,"  Deep neural language models such as BERT have enabled substantial recent
advances in many natural language processing tasks. Due to the effort and
computational cost involved in their pre-training, language-specific models are
typically introduced only for a small number of high-resource languages such as
English. While multilingual models covering large numbers of languages are
available, recent work suggests monolingual training can produce better models,
and our understanding of the tradeoffs between mono- and multilingual training
is incomplete. In this paper, we introduce a simple, fully automated pipeline
for creating language-specific BERT models from Wikipedia data and introduce 42
new such models, most for languages up to now lacking dedicated deep neural
language models. We assess the merits of these models using the
state-of-the-art UDify parser on Universal Dependencies data, contrasting
performance with results using the multilingual BERT model. We find that UDify
using WikiBERT models outperforms the parser using mBERT on average, with the
language-specific models showing substantially improved performance for some
languages, yet limited improvement or a decrease in performance for others. We
also present preliminary results as first steps toward an understanding of the
conditions under which language-specific models are most beneficial. All of the
methods and models introduced in this work are available under open licenses

symbolic approaches were developed to solve or to detect analogies between

Towards Fully Bilingual Deep Language Modeling,"  Language models based on deep neural networks have facilitated great advances
in natural language processing and understanding tasks in recent years. While
models covering a large number of languages have been introduced, their
multilinguality has come at a cost in terms of monolingual performance, and the
best-performing models at most tasks not involving cross-lingual transfer
remain monolingual. In this paper, we consider the question of whether it is
possible to pre-train a bilingual model for two remotely related languages
without compromising performance at either language. We collect pre-training
data, create a Finnish-English bilingual BERT model and evaluate its
performance on datasets used to evaluate the corresponding monolingual models.
Our bilingual model performs on par with Google's original English BERT on GLUE
and nearly matches the performance of monolingual Finnish BERT on a range of
Finnish NLP tasks, clearly outperforming multilingual BERT. We find that when
the model vocabulary size is increased, the BERT-Base architecture has
sufficient capacity to learn two remotely related languages to a level where it
achieves comparable performance with monolingual models, demonstrating the
feasibility of training fully bilingual deep language models. The model and all
tools involved in its creation are freely available at

"Relational Weight Priors in Neural Networks for Abstract Pattern
  Learning and Language Modelling","  Deep neural networks have become the dominant approach in natural language
processing (NLP). However, in recent years, it has become apparent that there
are shortcomings in systematicity that limit the performance and data
efficiency of deep learning in NLP. These shortcomings can be clearly shown in
lower-level artificial tasks, mostly on synthetic data. Abstract patterns are
the best known examples of a hard problem for neural networks in terms of
generalisation to unseen data. They are defined by relations between items,
such as equality, rather than their values. It has been argued that these
low-level problems demonstrate the inability of neural networks to learn
systematically. In this study, we propose Embedded Relation Based Patterns
(ERBP) as a novel way to create a relational inductive bias that encourages
learning equality and distance-based relations for abstract patterns. ERBP is
based on Relation Based Patterns (RBP), but modelled as a Bayesian prior on
network weights and implemented as a regularisation term in otherwise standard
network learning. ERBP is is easy to integrate into standard neural networks
and does not affect their learning capacity. In our experiments, ERBP priors
lead to almost perfect generalisation when learning abstract patterns from
synthetic noise-free sequences. ERBP also improves natural language models on
the word and character level and pitch prediction in melodies with RNN, GRU and
LSTM networks. We also find improvements in in the more complex tasks of
learning of graph edit distance and compositional sentence entailment. ERBP
consistently improves over RBP and over standard networks, showing that it
enables abstract pattern learning which contributes to performance in natural
language tasks.

"Off-the-shelf deep learning is not enough: parsimony, Bayes and
  causality","  Deep neural networks (""deep learning"") have emerged as a technology of choice
to tackle problems in natural language processing, computer vision, speech
recognition and gameplay, and in just a few years has led to superhuman level
performance and ushered in a new wave of ""AI."" Buoyed by these successes,
researchers in the physical sciences have made steady progress in incorporating
deep learning into their respective domains. However, such adoption brings
substantial challenges that need to be recognized and confronted. Here, we
discuss both opportunities and roadblocks to implementation of deep learning
within materials science, focusing on the relationship between correlative
nature of machine learning and causal hypothesis driven nature of physical
sciences. We argue that deep learning and AI are now well positioned to
revolutionize fields where causal links are known, as is the case for
applications in theory. When confounding factors are frozen or change only
weakly, this leaves open the pathway for effective deep learning solutions in
experimental domains. Similarly, these methods offer a pathway towards
understanding the physics of real-world systems, either via deriving reduced
representations, deducing algorithmic complexity, or recovering generative
physical models. However, extending deep learning and ""AI"" for models with
unclear causal relationship can produce misleading and potentially incorrect
results. Here, we argue the broad adoption of Bayesian methods incorporating
prior knowledge, development of DL solutions with incorporated physical
constraints, and ultimately adoption of causal models, offers a path forward
for fundamental and applied research. Most notably, while these advances can
change the way science is carried out in ways we cannot imagine, machine
learning is not going to substitute science any time soon.

Improving Retrieval-Based Question Answering with Deep Inference Models,"  Question answering is one of the most important and difficult applications at
the border of information retrieval and natural language processing, especially
when we talk about complex science questions which require some form of
inference to determine the correct answer. In this paper, we present a two-step
method that combines information retrieval techniques optimized for question
answering with deep learning models for natural language inference in order to
tackle the multi-choice question answering in the science domain. For each
question-answer pair, we use standard retrieval-based models to find relevant
candidate contexts and decompose the main problem into two different
sub-problems. First, assign correctness scores for each candidate answer based
on the context using retrieval models from Lucene. Second, we use deep learning
architectures to compute if a candidate answer can be inferred from some
well-chosen context consisting of sentences retrieved from the knowledge base.
In the end, all these solvers are combined using a simple neural network to
predict the correct answer. This proposed two-step model outperforms the best

Tackling Vision Language Tasks Through Learning Inner Monologues,"  Visual language tasks require AI models to comprehend and reason with both
visual and textual content. Driven by the power of Large Language Models
(LLMs), two prominent methods have emerged: (1) the hybrid integration between
LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where visual inputs are firstly
converted into language descriptions by VLMs, serving as inputs for LLMs to
generate final answer(s); (2) visual feature alignment in language space, where
visual inputs are encoded as embeddings and projected to LLMs' language space
via further supervised fine-tuning. The first approach provides light training
costs and interpretability but is hard to be optimized in an end-to-end
fashion. The second approach presents decent performance, but feature alignment
usually requires large amounts of training data and lacks interpretability. To
tackle this dilemma, we propose a novel approach, Inner Monologue Multi-Modal
Optimization (IMMO), to solve complex vision language problems by simulating
inner monologue processes, a cognitive process in which an individual engages
in silent verbal communication with themselves. We enable LLMs and VLMs to
interact through natural language conversation and propose to use a two-stage
training process to learn how to do the inner monologue (self-asking questions
and answering questions). IMMO is evaluated on two popular tasks and the
results suggest by emulating the cognitive phenomenon of internal dialogue, our
approach can enhance reasoning and explanation abilities, contributing to the
more effective fusion of vision and language models. More importantly, instead
of using predefined human-crafted monologues, IMMO learns this process within
the deep learning models, promising wider applicability to many different AI
problems beyond vision language tasks.

"Developing Linguistic Patterns to Mitigate Inherent Human Bias in
  Offensive Language Detection","  With the proliferation of social media, there has been a sharp increase in
offensive content, particularly targeting vulnerable groups, exacerbating
social problems such as hatred, racism, and sexism. Detecting offensive

human-bias in offensive language datasets is a major concern for deep learning
models. In this paper, we propose a linguistic data augmentation approach to
reduce bias in labeling processes, which aims to mitigate the influence of
human bias by leveraging the power of machines to improve the accuracy and
fairness of labeling processes. This approach has the potential to improve
offensive language classification tasks across multiple languages and reduce

"Unsupervised pre-training of graph transformers on patient population

as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and medical imaging.
However, it has not been fully explored for clinical data analysis. An immense
amount of clinical records are recorded, but still, data and labels can be
scarce for data collected in small hospitals or dealing with rare diseases. In
such scenarios, pre-training on a larger set of unlabelled clinical data could
improve performance. In this paper, we propose novel unsupervised pre-training
techniques designed for heterogeneous, multi-modal clinical data for patient
outcome prediction inspired by masked language modeling (MLM), by leveraging
graph deep learning over population graphs. To this end, we further propose a
graph-transformer-based network, designed to handle heterogeneous clinical

we translate the success of masking-based pre-training in other domains to

this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep graph matching and searching (DGMS)
model based on graph neural networks for the task of semantic code retrieval.
To this end, we first represent both natural language query texts and
programming language code snippets with the unified graph-structured data, and
then use the proposed graph matching and searching model to retrieve the best
matching code snippet. In particular, DGMS not only captures more structural
information for individual query texts or code snippets but also learns the
fine-grained similarity between them by cross-attention based semantic matching
operations. We evaluate the proposed DGMS model on two public code retrieval
datasets with two representative programming languages (i.e., Java and Python).
Experiment results demonstrate that DGMS significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models by a large margin on both datasets. Moreover,
our extensive ablation studies systematically investigate and illustrate the
impact of each part of DGMS.

Automatic Summarization of Natural Language,"  Automatic summarization of natural language is a current topic in computer
science research and industry, studied for decades because of its usefulness
across multiple domains. For example, summarization is necessary to create
reviews such as this one. Research and applications have achieved some success
in extractive summarization (where key sentences are curated), however,
abstractive summarization (synthesis and re-stating) is a hard problem and
generally unsolved in computer science. This literature review contrasts
historical progress up through current state of the art, comparing dimensions
such as: extractive vs. abstractive, supervised vs. unsupervised, NLP (Natural
Language Processing) vs Knowledge-based, deep learning vs algorithms,
structured vs. unstructured sources, and measurement metrics such as Rouge and
BLEU. Multiple dimensions are contrasted since current research uses
combinations of approaches as seen in the review matrix. Throughout this
summary, synthesis and critique is provided. This review concludes with
insights for improved abstractive summarization measurement, with surprising
implications for detecting understanding and comprehension in general.

Sparse Deep Learning for Time Series Data: Theory and Applications,"  Sparse deep learning has become a popular technique for improving the
performance of deep neural networks in areas such as uncertainty
quantification, variable selection, and large-scale network compression.
However, most existing research has focused on problems where the observations
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and there has been little
work on the problems where the observations are dependent, such as time series
data and sequential data in natural language processing. This paper aims to
address this gap by studying the theory for sparse deep learning with dependent
data. We show that sparse recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be consistently
estimated, and their predictions are asymptotically normally distributed under
appropriate assumptions, enabling the prediction uncertainty to be correctly
quantified. Our numerical results show that sparse deep learning outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, such as conformal predictions, in prediction
uncertainty quantification for time series data. Furthermore, our results
indicate that the proposed method can consistently identify the autoregressive
order for time series data and outperform existing methods in large-scale model
compression. Our proposed method has important practical implications in fields
such as finance, healthcare, and energy, where both accurate point estimates
and prediction uncertainty quantification are of concern.

"Differentially Private Natural Language Models: Recent Advances and
  Future Directions","  Recent developments in deep learning have led to great success in various
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, these applications may
involve data that contain sensitive information. Therefore, how to achieve good
performance while also protecting the privacy of sensitive data is a crucial
challenge in NLP. To preserve privacy, Differential Privacy (DP), which can
prevent reconstruction attacks and protect against potential side knowledge, is
becoming a de facto technique for private data analysis. In recent years, NLP
in DP models (DP-NLP) has been studied from different perspectives, which
deserves a comprehensive review. In this paper, we provide the first systematic
review of recent advances in DP deep learning models in NLP. In particular, we
first discuss some differences and additional challenges of DP-NLP compared
with the standard DP deep learning. Then, we investigate some existing work on
DP-NLP and present its recent developments from three aspects: gradient
perturbation based methods, embedding vector perturbation based methods, and
ensemble model based methods. We also discuss some challenges and future
directions.

Do Large Language Models Mirror Cognitive Language Processing?,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in text
comprehension and logical reasoning, indicating that the text representations
learned by LLMs can facilitate their language processing capabilities. In
cognitive science, brain cognitive processing signals are typically utilized to
study human language processing. Therefore, it is natural to ask how well the
text embeddings from LLMs align with the brain cognitive processing signals,
and how training strategies affect the LLM-brain alignment? In this paper, we
employ Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to measure the alignment
between 23 mainstream LLMs and fMRI signals of the brain to evaluate how
effectively LLMs simulate cognitive language processing. We empirically
investigate the impact of various factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model
scaling, alignment training, and prompts) on such LLM-brain alignment.
Experimental results indicate that pre-training data size and model scaling are
positively correlated with LLM-brain similarity, and alignment training can
significantly improve LLM-brain similarity. Explicit prompts contribute to the
consistency of LLMs with brain cognitive language processing, while nonsensical
noisy prompts may attenuate such alignment. Additionally, the performance of a
wide range of LLM evaluations (e.g., MMLU, Chatbot Arena) is highly correlated
with the LLM-brain similarity.

"Social and environmental impact of recent developments in machine
  learning on biology and chemistry research","  Potential societal and environmental effects such as the rapidly increasing
resource use and the associated environmental impact, reproducibility issues,
and exclusivity, the privatization of ML research leading to a public research
brain-drain, a narrowing of the research effort caused by a focus on deep
learning, and the introduction of biases through a lack of sociodemographic
diversity in data and personnel caused by recent developments in machine
learning are a current topic of discussion and scientific publications.
However, these discussions and publications focus mainly on computer
science-adjacent fields, including computer vision and natural language
processing or basic ML research. Using bibliometric analysis of the complete
and full-text analysis of the open-access literature, we show that the same
observations can be made for applied machine learning in chemistry and biology.
These developments can potentially affect basic and applied research, such as

classifying new data. While it is mainly applied in computer vision, in this
work, we build upon prior research and further explore the extension of
prototypical networks to natural language processing. We introduce a learned
weighted similarity measure that enhances the similarity computation by
focusing on informative dimensions of pre-trained sentence embeddings.
Additionally, we propose a post-hoc explainability mechanism that extracts
prediction-relevant words from both the prototype and input sentences. Finally,
we empirically demonstrate that our proposed method not only improves
predictive performance on the AG News and RT Polarity datasets over a previous

Applications of Deep Neural Networks with Keras,"  Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks.
Through a combination of advanced training techniques and neural network
architectural components, it is now possible to create neural networks that can

On the Efficiency of NLP-Inspired Methods for Tabular Deep Learning,"  Recent advancements in tabular deep learning (DL) have led to substantial
performance improvements, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models.
With the adoption of techniques from natural language processing (NLP), such as
language model-based approaches, DL models for tabular data have also grown in
complexity and size. Although tabular datasets do not typically pose
scalability issues, the escalating size of these models has raised efficiency
concerns. Despite its importance, efficiency has been relatively underexplored

Deep learning and sub-word-unit approach in written art generation,"  Automatic poetry generation is novel and interesting application of natural
language processing research. It became more popular during the last few years
due to the rapid development of technology and neural computing power. This
line of research can be applied to the study of linguistics and literature, for
social science experiments, or simply for entertainment. The most effective
known method of artificial poem generation uses recurrent neural networks
(RNN). We also used RNNs to generate poems in the style of Adam Mickiewicz. Our
network was trained on the Sir Thaddeus poem. For data pre-processing, we used
a specialized stemming tool, which is one of the major innovations and
contributions of this work. Our experiment was conducted on the source text,
divided into sub-word units (at a level of resolution close to syllables). This
approach is novel and is not often employed in the published literature. The
subwords units seem to be a natural choice for analysis of the Polish language,
as the language is morphologically rich due to cases, gender forms and a large
vocabulary. Moreover, Sir Thaddeus contains rhymes, so the analysis of
syllables can be meaningful. We verified our model with different settings for
the temperature parameter, which controls the randomness of the generated text.
We also compared our results with similar models trained on the same text but
divided into characters (which is the most common approach alongside the use of
full word units). The differences were tremendous. Our solution generated much
better poems that were able to follow the metre and vocabulary of the source
data text.

"Rare Words: A Major Problem for Contextualized Embeddings And How to Fix
  it by Attentive Mimicking","  Pretraining deep neural network architectures with a language modeling
objective has brought large improvements for many natural language processing
tasks. Exemplified by BERT, a recently proposed such architecture, we
demonstrate that despite being trained on huge amounts of data, deep language
models still struggle to understand rare words. To fix this problem, we adapt
Attentive Mimicking, a method that was designed to explicitly learn embeddings
for rare words, to deep language models. In order to make this possible, we
introduce one-token approximation, a procedure that enables us to use Attentive
Mimicking even when the underlying language model uses subword-based
tokenization, i.e., it does not assign embeddings to all words. To evaluate our
method, we create a novel dataset that tests the ability of language models to
capture semantic properties of words without any task-specific fine-tuning.
Using this dataset, we show that adding our adapted version of Attentive
Mimicking to BERT does indeed substantially improve its understanding of rare
words.

"Protein sequence classification using natural language processing

determining their roles within organisms. Traditional methods for determining
protein function are time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study addresses
the increasing demand for precise, effective, and automated protein sequence
classification methods by employing natural language processing (NLP)
techniques on a dataset comprising 75 target protein classes. We explored
various machine learning and deep learning models, including K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Multinomial Na\""ive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Voting and Stacking
classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
and transformer models (BertForSequenceClassification, DistilBERT, and
ProtBert). Experiments were conducted using amino acid ranges of 1-4 grams for
machine learning models and different sequence lengths for CNN and LSTM models.
The KNN algorithm performed best on tri-gram data with 70.0% accuracy and a
macro F1 score of 63.0%. The Voting classifier achieved best performance with
74.0% accuracy and an F1 score of 65.0%, while the Stacking classifier reached
75.0% accuracy and an F1 score of 64.0%. ProtBert demonstrated the highest
performance among transformer models, with a accuracy 76.0% and F1 score 61.0%
which is same for all three transformer models. Advanced NLP techniques,
particularly ensemble methods and transformer models, show great potential in

Knowledge Graph Extraction from Videos,"  Nearly all existing techniques for automated video annotation (or captioning)
describe videos using natural language sentences. However, this has several
shortcomings: (i) it is very hard to then further use the generated natural
language annotations in automated data processing, (ii) generating natural
language annotations requires to solve the hard subtask of generating
semantically precise and syntactically correct natural language sentences,
which is actually unrelated to the task of video annotation, (iii) it is
difficult to quantitatively measure performance, as standard metrics (e.g.,
accuracy and F1-score) are inapplicable, and (iv) annotations are
language-specific. In this paper, we propose the new task of knowledge graph
extraction from videos, i.e., producing a description in the form of a
knowledge graph of the contents of a given video. Since no datasets exist for
this task, we also include a method to automatically generate them, starting

"Learning Convolutional Text Representations for Visual Question

that requires a deep understanding of both images and texts. In deep learning,
images are typically modeled through convolutional neural networks, and texts
are typically modeled through recurrent neural networks. While the requirement
for modeling images is similar to traditional computer vision tasks, such as
object recognition and image classification, visual question answering raises a
different need for textual representation as compared to other natural language

propose to rely on convolutional neural networks for learning textual
representations. By exploring the various properties of convolutional neural
networks specialized for text data, such as width and depth, we present our

representations and thus the overall accuracy of visual question answering
models. We also show that the text representation requirement in visual
question answering is more complicated and comprehensive than that in
conventional natural language processing tasks, making it a better task to
evaluate textual representation methods. Shallow models like fastText, which
can obtain comparable results with deep learning models in tasks like text

NegDL: Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning Based on Negative Database,"  In the era of big data, deep learning has become an increasingly popular
topic. It has outstanding achievements in the fields of image recognition,
object detection, and natural language processing et al. The first priority of
deep learning is exploiting valuable information from a large amount of data,
which will inevitably induce privacy issues that are worthy of attention.
Presently, several privacy-preserving deep learning methods have been proposed,
but most of them suffer from a non-negligible degradation of either efficiency
or accuracy. Negative database (\textit{NDB}) is a new type of data
representation which can protect data privacy by storing and utilizing the
complementary form of original data. In this paper, we propose a
privacy-preserving deep learning method named NegDL based on \textit{NDB}.
Specifically, private data are first converted to \textit{NDB} as the input of
deep learning models by a generation algorithm called \textit{QK}-hidden
algorithm, and then the sketches of \textit{NDB} are extracted for training and
inference. We demonstrate that the computational complexity of NegDL is the
same as the original deep learning model without privacy protection.
Experimental results on Breast Cancer, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the accuracy of NegDL could be comparable to the original deep
learning model in most cases, and it performs better than the method based on
differential privacy.

"A Survey of Methods for Addressing Class Imbalance in Deep-Learning
  Based Natural Language Processing","  Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks are naturally imbalanced, as
some target categories occur much more frequently than others in the real
world. In such scenarios, current NLP models still tend to perform poorly on
less frequent classes. Addressing class imbalance in NLP is an active research
topic, yet, finding a good approach for a particular task and imbalance
scenario is difficult.
  With this survey, the first overview on class imbalance in deep-learning
based NLP, we provide guidance for NLP researchers and practitioners dealing
with imbalanced data. We first discuss various types of controlled and
real-world class imbalance. Our survey then covers approaches that have been
explicitly proposed for class-imbalanced NLP tasks or, originating in the
computer vision community, have been evaluated on them. We organize the methods
by whether they are based on sampling, data augmentation, choice of loss
function, staged learning, or model design. Finally, we discuss open problems
such as dealing with multi-label scenarios, and propose systematic benchmarking
and reporting in order to move forward on this problem as a community.

Deep Active Learning for Named Entity Recognition,"  Deep learning has yielded state-of-the-art performance on many natural
language processing tasks including named entity recognition (NER). However,
this typically requires large amounts of labeled data. In this work, we
demonstrate that the amount of labeled training data can be drastically reduced
when deep learning is combined with active learning. While active learning is
sample-efficient, it can be computationally expensive since it requires
iterative retraining. To speed this up, we introduce a lightweight architecture
for NER, viz., the CNN-CNN-LSTM model consisting of convolutional character and
word encoders and a long short term memory (LSTM) tag decoder. The model
achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets for the task
while being computationally much more efficient than best performing models. We
carry out incremental active learning, during the training process, and are
able to nearly match state-of-the-art performance with just 25\% of the
original training data.

Low-Rank Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Multi-Task Learning,"  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning method based on the
deep convolutional network. The proposed deep network has four convolutional
layers, three max-pooling layers, and two parallel fully connected layers. To
adjust the deep network to multi-task learning problem, we propose to learn a
low-rank deep network so that the relation among different tasks can be
explored. We proposed to minimize the number of independent parameter rows of
one fully connected layer to explore the relations among different tasks, which
is measured by the nuclear norm of the parameter of one fully connected layer,
and seek a low-rank parameter matrix. Meanwhile, we also propose to regularize
another fully connected layer by sparsity penalty, so that the useful features
learned by the lower layers can be selected. The learning problem is solved by
an iterative algorithm based on gradient descent and back-propagation
algorithms. The proposed algorithm is evaluated over benchmark data sets of
multiple face attribute prediction, multi-task natural language processing, and
joint economics index predictions. The evaluation results show the advantage of
the low-rank deep CNN model over multi-task problems.

An End-to-end Neural Natural Language Interface for Databases,"  The ability to extract insights from new data sets is critical for decision
making. Visual interactive tools play an important role in data exploration
since they provide non-technical users with an effective way to visually
compose queries and comprehend the results. Natural language has recently
gained traction as an alternative query interface to databases with the
potential to enable non-expert users to formulate complex questions and
information needs efficiently and effectively. However, understanding natural
language questions and translating them accurately to SQL is a challenging
task, and thus Natural Language Interfaces for Databases (NLIDBs) have not yet
made their way into practical tools and commercial products.
  In this paper, we present DBPal, a novel data exploration tool with a natural
language interface. DBPal leverages recent advances in deep models to make
query understanding more robust in the following ways: First, DBPal uses a deep
model to translate natural language statements to SQL, making the translation
process more robust to paraphrasing and other linguistic variations. Second, to
support the users in phrasing questions without knowing the database schema and
the query features, DBPal provides a learned auto-completion model that
suggests partial query extensions to users during query formulation and thus
helps to write complex queries.

"Subsentence Extraction from Text Using Coverage-Based Deep Learning
  Language Models","  Sentiment prediction remains a challenging and unresolved task in various
research fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. This
stems from its high degree of subjectivity and limited input sources that can
effectively capture the actual sentiment. This can be even more challenging
with only text-based input. Meanwhile, the rise of deep learning and an
unprecedented large volume of data have paved the way for artificial
intelligence to perform impressively accurate predictions or even human-level
reasoning. Drawing inspiration from this, we propose a coverage-based sentiment
and subsentence extraction system that estimates a span of input text and
recursively feeds this information back to the networks. The predicted
subsentence consists of auxiliary information expressing a sentiment. This is
an important building block for enabling vivid and epic sentiment delivery
(within the scope of this paper) and for other natural language processing
tasks such as text summarisation and Q&A. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in subsentence prediction (i.e.,
Average Jaccard scores from 0.72 to 0.89). For the evaluation, we designed
rigorous experiments consisting of 24 ablation studies. Finally, our learned
lessons are returned to the community by sharing software packages and a public
dataset that can reproduce the results presented in this paper.

"Superiorities of Deep Extreme Learning Machines against Convolutional
  Neural Networks","  Deep Learning (DL) is a machine learning procedure for artificial
intelligence that analyzes the input data in detail by increasing neuron sizes
and number of the hidden layers. DL has a popularity with the common
improvements on the graphical processing unit capabilities. Increasing number
of the neuron sizes at each layer and hidden layers is directly related to the
computation time and training speed of the classifier models. The
classification parameters including neuron weights, output weights, and biases
need to be optimized for obtaining an optimum model. Most of the popular DL
algorithms require long training times for optimization of the parameters with
feature learning progresses and back-propagated training procedures. Reducing
the training time and providing a real-time decision system are the basic focus
points of the novel approaches. Deep Extreme Learning machines (Deep ELM)
classifier model is one of the fastest and effective way to meet fast
classification problems. In this study, Deep ELM model, its superiorities and
weaknesses are discussed, the problems that are more suitable for the

Ranking Creative Language Characteristics in Small Data Scenarios,"  The ability to rank creative natural language provides an important general
tool for downstream language understanding and generation. However, current
deep ranking models require substantial amounts of labeled data that are
difficult and expensive to obtain for different domains, languages and creative
characteristics. A recent neural approach, the DirectRanker, promises to reduce
the amount of training data needed but its application to text isn't fully
explored. We therefore adapt the DirectRanker to provide a new deep model for
ranking creative language with small data. We compare DirectRanker with a
Bayesian approach, Gaussian process preference learning (GPPL), which has
previously been shown to work well with sparse data. Our experiments with
sparse training data show that while the performance of standard neural ranking
approaches collapses with small training datasets, DirectRanker remains
effective. We find that combining DirectRanker with GPPL increases performance
across different settings by leveraging the complementary benefits of both
models. Our combined approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
humor and metaphor novelty tasks, increasing Spearman's $\rho$ by 14% and 16%

The Natural Language Decathlon: Multitask Learning as Question Answering,"  Deep learning has improved performance on many natural language processing
(NLP) tasks individually. However, general NLP models cannot emerge within a
paradigm that focuses on the particularities of a single metric, dataset, and
task. We introduce the Natural Language Decathlon (decaNLP), a challenge that
spans ten tasks: question answering, machine translation, summarization,
natural language inference, sentiment analysis, semantic role labeling,
zero-shot relation extraction, goal-oriented dialogue, semantic parsing, and
commonsense pronoun resolution. We cast all tasks as question answering over a
context. Furthermore, we present a new Multitask Question Answering Network
(MQAN) jointly learns all tasks in decaNLP without any task-specific modules or
parameters in the multitask setting. MQAN shows improvements in transfer
learning for machine translation and named entity recognition, domain
adaptation for sentiment analysis and natural language inference, and zero-shot
capabilities for text classification. We demonstrate that the MQAN's
multi-pointer-generator decoder is key to this success and performance further
improves with an anti-curriculum training strategy. Though designed for
decaNLP, MQAN also achieves state of the art results on the WikiSQL semantic
parsing task in the single-task setting. We also release code for procuring and
processing data, training and evaluating models, and reproducing all
experiments for decaNLP.

"Harnessing Transfer Learning from Swahili: Advancing Solutions for
  Comorian Dialects","  If today some African languages like Swahili have enough resources to develop
high-performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, many other languages
spoken on the continent are still lacking such support. For these languages,
still in their infancy, several possibilities exist to address this critical
lack of data. Among them is Transfer Learning, which allows low-resource
languages to benefit from the good representation of other languages that are
similar to them. In this work, we adopt a similar approach, aiming to pioneer
NLP technologies for Comorian, a group of four languages or dialects belonging
to the Bantu family.
  Our approach is initially motivated by the hypothesis that if a human can
understand a different language from their native language with little or no
effort, it would be entirely possible to model this process on a machine. To
achieve this, we consider ways to construct Comorian datasets mixed with
Swahili. One thing to note here is that in terms of Swahili data, we only focus
on elements that are closest to Comorian by calculating lexical distances
between candidate and source data. We empirically test this hypothesis in two
use cases: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT). Our
MT model achieved ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.6826, 0.42, and
0.6532, respectively, while our ASR system recorded a WER of 39.50\% and a CER
of 13.76\%. This research is crucial for advancing NLP in underrepresented

Deep Natural Language Processing for LinkedIn Search,"  Many search systems work with large amounts of natural language data, e.g.,

Towards More Robust Natural Language Understanding,"  Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a branch of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) that uses intelligent computer software to understand texts
that encode human knowledge. Recent years have witnessed notable progress
across various NLU tasks with deep learning techniques, especially with
pretrained language models. Besides proposing more advanced model
architectures, constructing more reliable and trustworthy datasets also plays a
huge role in improving NLU systems, without which it would be impossible to
train a decent NLU model. It's worth noting that the human ability of
understanding natural language is flexible and robust. On the contrary, most of
existing NLU systems fail to achieve desirable performance on out-of-domain
data or struggle on handling challenging items (e.g., inherently ambiguous
items, adversarial items) in the real world. Therefore, in order to have NLU
models understand human language more effectively, it is expected to prioritize
the study on robust natural language understanding. In this thesis, we deem
that NLU systems are consisting of two components: NLU models and NLU datasets.
As such, we argue that, to achieve robust NLU, the model architecture/training
and the dataset are equally important. Specifically, we will focus on three NLU
tasks to illustrate the robustness problem in different NLU tasks and our
contributions (i.e., novel models and new datasets) to help achieve more robust
natural language understanding. Moving forward, the ultimate goal for robust
natural language understanding is to build NLU models which can behave humanly.
That is, it's expected that robust NLU systems are capable to transfer the
knowledge from training corpus to unseen documents more reliably and survive
when encountering challenging items even if the system doesn't know a priori of
users' inputs.

"Robotic Planning under Uncertainty in Spatiotemporal Environments in
  Expeditionary Science","  In the expeditionary sciences, spatiotemporally varying environments --
hydrothermal plumes, algal blooms, lava flows, or animal migrations -- are
ubiquitous. Mobile robots are uniquely well-suited to study these dynamic,
mesoscale natural environments. We formalize expeditionary science as a
sequential decision-making problem, modeled using the language of
partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Solving the
expeditionary science POMDP under real-world constraints requires efficient
probabilistic modeling and decision-making in problems with complex dynamics
and observational models. Previous work in informative path planning, adaptive
sampling, and experimental design have shown compelling results, largely in
static environments, using data-driven models and information-based rewards.
However, these methodologies do not trivially extend to expeditionary science
in spatiotemporal environments: they generally do not make use of scientific
knowledge such as equations of state dynamics, they focus on information
gathering as opposed to scientific task execution, and they make use of
decision-making approaches that scale poorly to large, continuous problems with
long planning horizons and real-time operational constraints. In this work, we
discuss these and other challenges related to probabilistic modeling and
decision-making in expeditionary science, and present some of our preliminary
work that addresses these gaps. We ground our results in a real expeditionary
science deployment of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the deep ocean
for hydrothermal vent discovery and characterization. Our concluding thoughts
highlight remaining work to be done, and the challenges that merit
consideration by the reinforcement learning and decision-making community.

text for the clinical domain. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed methods by achieving 90.6% accuracy in medical domain natural

to correlate with firm investment, employment, and excess market returns, has
had substantive impact in both the private sector and academia. Yet, as we

annotator disagreements a reflection of ambiguity in language? (2) Do
alternative text measurements correlate with one another and with measures of
external predictive validity? We find for this application (1) some annotator
disagreements of economic policy uncertainty can be attributed to ambiguity in

machine learning classifiers results in low correlation, a concerning
implication for the validity of the index.

"Leveraging Large Language Models for Knowledge-free Weak Supervision in
  Clinical Natural Language Processing","  The performance of deep learning-based natural language processing systems is
based on large amounts of labeled training data which, in the clinical domain,
are not easily available or affordable. Weak supervision and in-context
learning offer partial solutions to this issue, particularly using large
language models (LLMs), but their performance still trails traditional
supervised methods with moderate amounts of gold-standard data. In particular,
inferencing with LLMs is computationally heavy. We propose an approach
leveraging fine-tuning LLMs and weak supervision with virtually no domain
knowledge that still achieves consistently dominant performance. Using a
prompt-based approach, the LLM is used to generate weakly-labeled data for
training a downstream BERT model. The weakly supervised model is then further
fine-tuned on small amounts of gold standard data. We evaluate this approach
using Llama2 on three different n2c2 datasets. With no more than 10 gold
standard notes, our final BERT models weakly supervised by fine-tuned

the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple
parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather
than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time
series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a
time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that
prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate
two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the
detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly
asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies.
Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to
guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets
spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method
significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect
to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding
anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in
performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.

RPC Considered Harmful: Fast Distributed Deep Learning on RDMA,"  Deep learning emerges as an important new resource-intensive workload and has
been successfully applied in computer vision, speech, natural language
processing, and so on. Distributed deep learning is becoming a necessity to
cope with growing data and model sizes. Its computation is typically
characterized by a simple tensor data abstraction to model multi-dimensional
matrices, a data-flow graph to model computation, and iterative executions with
relatively frequent synchronizations, thereby making it substantially different
from Map/Reduce style distributed big data computation.
  RPC, commonly used as the communication primitive, has been adopted by
popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, which uses gRPC. We show
that RPC is sub-optimal for distributed deep learning computation, especially
on an RDMA-capable network. The tensor abstraction and data-flow graph, coupled
with an RDMA network, offers the opportunity to reduce the unnecessary overhead
(e.g., memory copy) without sacrificing programmability and generality. In
particular, from a data access point of view, a remote machine is abstracted
just as a ""device"" on an RDMA channel, with a simple memory interface for
allocating, reading, and writing memory regions. Our graph analyzer looks at
both the data flow graph and the tensors to optimize memory allocation and
remote data access using this interface. The result is up to 25 times speedup
in representative deep learning benchmarks against the standard gRPC in
TensorFlow and up to 169% improvement even against an RPC implementation
optimized for RDMA, leading to faster convergence in the training process.

"Enhancing Essay Scoring with Adversarial Weights Perturbation and
  Metric-specific AttentionPooling","  The objective of this study is to improve automated feedback tools designed
for English Language Learners (ELLs) through the utilization of data science
techniques encompassing machine learning, natural language processing, and
educational data analytics. Automated essay scoring (AES) research has made
strides in evaluating written essays, but it often overlooks the specific needs
of English Language Learners (ELLs) in language development. This study
explores the application of BERT-related techniques to enhance the assessment
of ELLs' writing proficiency within AES.
  To address the specific needs of ELLs, we propose the use of DeBERTa, a
state-of-the-art neural language model, for improving automated feedback tools.
DeBERTa, pretrained on large text corpora using self-supervised learning,
learns universal language representations adaptable to various natural language
understanding tasks. The model incorporates several innovative techniques,
including adversarial training through Adversarial Weights Perturbation (AWP)
and Metric-specific AttentionPooling (6 kinds of AP) for each label in the
competition.
  The primary focus of this research is to investigate the impact of
hyperparameters, particularly the adversarial learning rate, on the performance
of the model. By fine-tuning the hyperparameter tuning process, including the
influence of 6AP and AWP, the resulting models can provide more accurate
evaluations of language proficiency and support tailored learning tasks for
ELLs. This work has the potential to significantly benefit ELLs by improving
their English language proficiency and facilitating their educational journey.

A Perspective on Deep Learning for Molecular Modeling and Simulations,"  Deep learning is transforming many areas in science, and it has great
potential in modeling molecular systems. However, unlike the mature deployment
of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, its
development in molecular modeling and simulations is still at an early stage,
largely because the inductive biases of molecules are completely different from
those of images or texts. Footed on these differences, we first reviewed the
limitations of traditional deep learning models from the perspective of
molecular physics, and wrapped up some relevant technical advancement at the
interface between molecular modeling and deep learning. We do not focus merely
on the ever more complex neural network models, instead, we emphasize the
theories and ideas behind modern deep learning. We hope that transacting these
ideas into molecular modeling will create new opportunities. For this purpose,
we summarized several representative applications, ranging from supervised to
unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and discussed their connections with
the emerging trends in deep learning. Finally, we outlook promising directions
which may help address the existing issues in the current framework of deep
molecular modeling.

"Natural Language Processing Methods to Identify Oncology Patients at
  High Risk for Acute Care with Clinical Notes","  Clinical notes are an essential component of a health record. This paper
evaluates how natural language processing (NLP) can be used to identify the
risk of acute care use (ACU) in oncology patients, once chemotherapy starts.
Risk prediction using structured health data (SHD) is now standard, but
predictions using free-text formats are complex. This paper explores the use of
free-text notes for the prediction of ACU instead of SHD. Deep Learning models
were compared to manually engineered language features. Results show that SHD
models minimally outperform NLP models; an l1-penalised logistic regression
with SHD achieved a C-statistic of 0.748 (95%-CI: 0.735, 0.762), while the same
model with language features achieved 0.730 (95%-CI: 0.717, 0.745) and a
transformer-based model achieved 0.702 (95%-CI: 0.688, 0.717). This paper shows
how language models can be used in clinical applications and underlines how

"A Legal Framework for Natural Language Processing Model Training in
  Portugal","  Recent advances in deep learning have promoted the advent of many
computational systems capable of performing intelligent actions that, until
then, were restricted to the human intellect. In the particular case of human
languages, these advances allowed the introduction of applications like ChatGPT
that are capable of generating coherent text without being explicitly
programmed to do so. Instead, these models use large volumes of textual data to
learn meaningful representations of human languages. Associated with these
advances, concerns about copyright and data privacy infringements caused by
these applications have emerged. Despite these concerns, the pace at which new
natural language processing applications continued to be developed largely
outperformed the introduction of new regulations. Today, communication barriers
between legal experts and computer scientists motivate many unintentional legal

A Robust Hybrid Approach for Textual Document Classification,"  Text document classification is an important task for diverse natural
language processing based applications. Traditional machine learning approaches
mainly focused on reducing dimensionality of textual data to perform
classification. This although improved the overall classification accuracy, the
classifiers still faced sparsity problem due to lack of better data
representation techniques. Deep learning based text document classification, on
the other hand, benefitted greatly from the invention of word embeddings that
have solved the sparsity problem and researchers focus mainly remained on the
development of deep architectures. Deeper architectures, however, learn some
redundant features that limit the performance of deep learning based solutions.
In this paper, we propose a two stage text document classification methodology
which combines traditional feature engineering with automatic feature
engineering (using deep learning). The proposed methodology comprises a filter
based feature selection (FSE) algorithm followed by a deep convolutional neural
network. This methodology is evaluated on the two most commonly used public
datasets, i.e., 20 Newsgroups data and BBC news data. Evaluation results reveal
that the proposed methodology outperforms the state-of-the-art of both the

"Text-to-Battery Recipe: A language modeling-based protocol for automatic
  battery recipe extraction and retrieval","  Recent studies have increasingly applied natural language processing (NLP) to
automatically extract experimental research data from the extensive battery
materials literature. Despite the complex process involved in battery
manufacturing -- from material synthesis to cell assembly -- there has been no
comprehensive study systematically organizing this information. In response, we
propose a language modeling-based protocol, Text-to-Battery Recipe (T2BR), for
the automatic extraction of end-to-end battery recipes, validated using a case
study on batteries containing LiFePO4 cathode material. We report machine
learning-based paper filtering models, screening 2,174 relevant papers from the
keyword-based search results, and unsupervised topic models to identify 2,876
paragraphs related to cathode synthesis and 2,958 paragraphs related to cell
assembly. Then, focusing on the two topics, two deep learning-based named
entity recognition models are developed to extract a total of 30 entities --
including precursors, active materials, and synthesis methods -- achieving F1
scores of 88.18% and 94.61%. The accurate extraction of entities enables the
systematic generation of 165 end-toend recipes of LiFePO4 batteries. Our
protocol and results offer valuable insights into specific trends, such as
associations between precursor materials and synthesis methods, or combinations
between different precursor materials. We anticipate that our findings will
serve as a foundational knowledge base for facilitating battery-recipe
information retrieval. The proposed protocol will significantly accelerate the

Deep Latent-Variable Models for Text Generation,"  Text generation aims to produce human-like natural language output for
down-stream tasks. It covers a wide range of applications like machine
translation, document summarization, dialogue generation and so on. Recently
deep neural network-based end-to-end architectures have been widely adopted.
The end-to-end approach conflates all sub-modules, which used to be designed by
complex handcrafted rules, into a holistic encode-decode architecture. Given
enough training data, it is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance yet
avoiding the need of language/domain-dependent knowledge. Nonetheless, deep
learning models are known to be extremely data-hungry, and text generated from
them usually suffer from low diversity, interpretability and controllability.
As a result, it is difficult to trust the output from them in real-life
applications. Deep latent-variable models, by specifying the probabilistic
distribution over an intermediate latent process, provide a potential way of
addressing these problems while maintaining the expressive power of deep neural
networks. This dissertation presents how deep latent-variable models can
improve over the standard encoder-decoder model for text generation.

"Is Word Segmentation Necessary for Deep Learning of Chinese
  Representations?","  Segmenting a chunk of text into words is usually the first step of processing
Chinese text, but its necessity has rarely been explored. In this paper, we ask
the fundamental question of whether Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is
necessary for deep learning-based Chinese Natural Language Processing. We
benchmark neural word-based models which rely on word segmentation against
neural char-based models which do not involve word segmentation in four
end-to-end NLP benchmark tasks: language modeling, machine translation,
sentence matching/paraphrase and text classification. Through direct
comparisons between these two types of models, we find that char-based models
consistently outperform word-based models. Based on these observations, we
conduct comprehensive experiments to study why word-based models underperform
char-based models in these deep learning-based NLP tasks. We show that it is
because word-based models are more vulnerable to data sparsity and the presence
of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, and thus more prone to overfitting. We hope
this paper could encourage researchers in the community to rethink the
necessity of word segmentation in deep learning-based Chinese Natural Language

Emergence of Numeric Concepts in Multi-Agent Autonomous Communication,"  With the rapid development of deep learning, most of current state-of-the-art
techniques in natural langauge processing are based on deep learning models
trained with argescaled static textual corpora. However, we human beings learn
and understand in a different way. Thus, grounded language learning argues that
models need to learn and understand language by the experience and perceptions
obtained by interacting with enviroments, like how humans do. With the help of
deep reinforcement learning techniques, there are already lots of works
focusing on facilitating the emergence of communication protocols that have
compositionalities like natural languages among computational agents
population. Unlike these works, we, on the other hand, focus on the numeric
concepts which correspond to abstractions in cognition and function words in
natural language. Based on a specifically designed language game, we verify
that computational agents are capable of transmitting numeric concepts during
autonomous communication, and the emergent communication protocols can reflect
the underlying structure of meaning space. Although their encodeing method is
not compositional like natural languages from a perspective of human beings,
the emergent languages can be generalised to unseen inputs and, more
importantly, are easier for models to learn. Besides, iterated learning can
help further improving the compositionality of the emergent languages, under
the measurement of topological similarity. Furthermore, we experiment another
representation method, i.e. directly encode numerals into concatenations of
one-hot vectors, and find that the emergent languages would become
compositional like human natural languages. Thus, we argue that there are 2
important factors for the emergence of compositional languages.

"Compressible Dynamics in Deep Overparameterized Low-Rank Learning &
  Adaptation","  While overparameterization in machine learning models offers great benefits
in terms of optimization and generalization, it also leads to increased
computational requirements as model sizes grow. In this work, we show that by
leveraging the inherent low-dimensional structures of data and compressible
dynamics within the model parameters, we can reap the benefits of
overparameterization without the computational burdens. In practice, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for deep low-rank matrix
completion as well as fine-tuning language models. Our approach is grounded in
theoretical findings for deep overparameterized low-rank matrix recovery, where
we show that the learning dynamics of each weight matrix are confined to an
invariant low-dimensional subspace. Consequently, we can construct and train
compact, highly compressed factorizations possessing the same benefits as their
overparameterized counterparts. In the context of deep matrix completion, our
technique substantially improves training efficiency while retaining the
advantages of overparameterization. For language model fine-tuning, we propose
a method called ""Deep LoRA"", which improves the existing low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) technique, leading to reduced overfitting and a simplified
hyperparameter setup, while maintaining comparable efficiency. We validate the
effectiveness of Deep LoRA on natural language tasks, particularly when
fine-tuning with limited data. Our code is available at

Word and Document Embeddings based on Neural Network Approaches,"  Data representation is a fundamental task in machine learning. The
representation of data affects the performance of the whole machine learning
system. In a long history, the representation of data is done by feature
engineering, and researchers aim at designing better features for specific
tasks. Recently, the rapid development of deep learning and representation
learning has brought new inspiration to various domains.
  In natural language processing, the most widely used feature representation
is the Bag-of-Words model. This model has the data sparsity problem and cannot
keep the word order information. Other features such as part-of-speech tagging
or more complex syntax features can only fit for specific tasks in most cases.
This thesis focuses on word representation and document representation. We
compare the existing systems and present our new model.
  First, for generating word embeddings, we make comprehensive comparisons
among existing word embedding models. In terms of theory, we figure out the
relationship between the two most important models, i.e., Skip-gram and GloVe.
In our experiments, we analyze three key points in generating word embeddings,
including the model construction, the training corpus and parameter design. We
evaluate word embeddings with three types of tasks, and we argue that they
cover the existing use of word embeddings. Through theory and practical
experiments, we present some guidelines for how to generate a good word
embedding.
  Second, in Chinese character or word representation. We introduce the joint
training of Chinese character and word. ...
  Third, for document representation, we analyze the existing document
representation models, including recursive NNs, recurrent NNs and convolutional
NNs. We point out the drawbacks of these models and present our new model, the
recurrent convolutional neural networks. ...

Deep Learning Models to Study Sentence Comprehension in the Human Brain,"  Recent artificial neural networks that process natural language achieve
unprecedented performance in tasks requiring sentence-level understanding. As
such, they could be interesting models of the integration of linguistic
information in the human brain. We review works that compare these artificial
language models with human brain activity and we assess the extent to which
this approach has improved our understanding of the neural processes involved
in natural language comprehension. Two main results emerge. First, the neural
representation of word meaning aligns with the context-dependent, dense word
vectors used by the artificial neural networks. Second, the processing
hierarchy that emerges within artificial neural networks broadly matches the
brain, but is surprisingly inconsistent across studies. We discuss current
challenges in establishing artificial neural networks as process models of
natural language comprehension. We suggest exploiting the highly structured
representational geometry of artificial neural networks when mapping
representations to brain data.

Fine-tuning BERT-based models for Plant Health Bulletin Classification,"  In the era of digitization, different actors in agriculture produce numerous
data. Such data contains already latent historical knowledge in the domain.
This knowledge enables us to precisely study natural hazards within global or
local aspects, and then improve the risk prevention tasks and augment the
yield, which helps to tackle the challenge of growing population and changing
alimentary habits. In particular, French Plants Health Bulletins (BSV, for its
name in French Bulletin de Sant{\'e} du V{\'e}g{\'e}tal) give information about
the development stages of phytosanitary risks in agricultural production.
However, they are written in natural language, thus, machines and human cannot
exploit them as efficiently as it could be. Natural language processing (NLP)
technologies aim to automatically process and analyze large amounts of natural
language data. Since the 2010s, with the increases in computational power and
parallelization, representation learning and deep learning methods became
widespread in NLP. Recent advancements Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers (BERT) inspire us to rethink of knowledge representation and
natural language understanding in plant health management domain. The goal in
this work is to propose a BERT-based approach to automatically classify the BSV
to make their data easily indexable. We sampled 200 BSV to finetune the
pretrained BERT language models and classify them as pest or/and disease and we
show preliminary results.

"Adversarial Robustness for Machine Learning Cyber Defenses Using Log
  Data","  There has been considerable and growing interest in applying machine learning
for cyber defenses. One promising approach has been to apply natural language
processing techniques to analyze logs data for suspicious behavior. A natural
question arises to how robust these systems are to adversarial attacks. Defense
against sophisticated attack is of particular concern for cyber defenses. In
this paper, we develop a testing framework to evaluate adversarial robustness
of machine learning cyber defenses, particularly those focused on log data. Our
framework uses techniques from deep reinforcement learning and adversarial
natural language processing. We validate our framework using a publicly
available dataset and demonstrate that our adversarial attack does succeed
against the target systems, revealing a potential vulnerability. We apply our
framework to analyze the influence of different levels of dropout
regularization and find that higher dropout levels increases robustness.
Moreover 90% dropout probability exhibited the highest level of robustness by a
significant margin, which suggests unusually high dropout may be necessary to
properly protect against adversarial attacks.

"Deep Cross-Modal Correlation Learning for Audio and Lyrics in Music
  Retrieval","  Little research focuses on cross-modal correlation learning where temporal
structures of different data modalities such as audio and lyrics are taken into
account. Stemming from the characteristic of temporal structures of music in
nature, we are motivated to learn the deep sequential correlation between audio
and lyrics. In this work, we propose a deep cross-modal correlation learning
architecture involving two-branch deep neural networks for audio modality and
text modality (lyrics). Different modality data are converted to the same
canonical space where inter modal canonical correlation analysis is utilized as
an objective function to calculate the similarity of temporal structures. This
is the first study on understanding the correlation between language and music
audio through deep architectures for learning the paired temporal correlation
of audio and lyrics. Pre-trained Doc2vec model followed by fully-connected
layers (fully-connected deep neural network) is used to represent lyrics. Two
significant contributions are made in the audio branch, as follows: i)
pre-trained CNN followed by fully-connected layers is investigated for
representing music audio. ii) We further suggest an end-to-end architecture
that simultaneously trains convolutional layers and fully-connected layers to
better learn temporal structures of music audio. Particularly, our end-to-end
deep architecture contains two properties: simultaneously implementing feature
learning and cross-modal correlation learning, and learning joint
representation by considering temporal structures. Experimental results, using
audio to retrieve lyrics or using lyrics to retrieve audio, verify the
effectiveness of the proposed deep correlation learning architectures in
cross-modal music retrieval.

Grammar-based Game Description Generation using Large Language Models,"  To lower the barriers to game design development, automated game design,
which generates game designs through computational processes, has been
explored. In automated game design, machine learning-based techniques such as
evolutionary algorithms have achieved success. Benefiting from the remarkable
advancements in deep learning, applications in computer vision and natural
language processing have progressed in level generation. However, due to the
limited amount of data in game design, the application of deep learning has
been insufficient for tasks such as game description generation. To pioneer a
new approach for handling limited data in automated game design, we focus on
the in-context learning of large language models (LLMs). LLMs can capture the
features of a task from a few demonstration examples and apply the capabilities
acquired during pre-training. We introduce the grammar of game descriptions,
which effectively structures the game design space, into the LLMs' reasoning
process. Grammar helps LLMs capture the characteristics of the complex task of
game description generation. Furthermore, we propose a decoding method that
iteratively improves the generated output by leveraging the grammar. Our
experiments demonstrate that this approach performs well in generating game
descriptions.

On Uncertainty In Natural Language Processing,"  The last decade in deep learning has brought on increasingly capable systems
that are deployed on a wide variety of applications. In natural language
processing, the field has been transformed by a number of breakthroughs
including large language models, which are used in increasingly many
user-facing applications. In order to reap the benefits of this technology and
reduce potential harms, it is important to quantify the reliability of model
predictions and the uncertainties that shroud their development.
  This thesis studies how uncertainty in natural language processing can be
characterized from a linguistic, statistical and neural perspective, and how it
can be reduced and quantified through the design of the experimental pipeline.
We further explore uncertainty quantification in modeling by theoretically and
empirically investigating the effect of inductive model biases in text
classification tasks. The corresponding experiments include data for three
different languages (Danish, English and Finnish) and tasks as well as a large
set of different uncertainty quantification approaches. Additionally, we
propose a method for calibrated sampling in natural language generation based
on non-exchangeable conformal prediction, which provides tighter token sets
with better coverage of the actual continuation. Lastly, we develop an approach
to quantify confidence in large black-box language models using auxiliary
predictors, where the confidence is predicted from the input to and generated
output text of the target model alone.

"LiPCoT: Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for Self-supervised
  Learning of Time Series Data via Language Models","  Language models have achieved remarkable success in various natural language
processing tasks. However, their application to time series data, a crucial
component in many domains, remains limited. This paper proposes LiPCoT (Linear
Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series), a novel tokenizer that
encodes time series data into a sequence of tokens, enabling self-supervised
learning of time series using existing Language model architectures such as
BERT. Unlike traditional time series tokenizers that rely heavily on CNN
encoder for time series feature generation, LiPCoT employs stochastic modeling
through linear predictive coding to create a latent space for time series
providing a compact yet rich representation of the inherent stochastic nature
of the data. Furthermore, LiPCoT is computationally efficient and can
effectively handle time series data with varying sampling rates and lengths,
overcoming common limitations of existing time series tokenizers. In this
proof-of-concept work, we present the effectiveness of LiPCoT in classifying
Parkinson's disease (PD) using an EEG dataset from 46 participants. In
particular, we utilize LiPCoT to encode EEG data into a small vocabulary of
tokens and then use BERT for self-supervised learning and the downstream task
of PD classification. We benchmark our approach against several

results reveal that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning outperformed
the best-performing existing method by 7.1% in precision, 2.3% in recall, 5.5%
in accuracy, 4% in AUC, and 5% in F1-score highlighting the potential for
self-supervised learning even on small datasets. Our work will inform future
foundational models for time series, particularly for self-supervised learning.

"Deep Collective Learning: Learning Optimal Inputs and Weights Jointly in
  Deep Neural Networks","  It is well observed that in deep learning and computer vision literature,
visual data are always represented in a manually designed coding scheme (eg.,
RGB images are represented as integers ranging from 0 to 255 for each channel)
when they are input to an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) for any learning
task. We boldly question whether the manually designed inputs are good for DNN
training for different tasks and study whether the input to a DNN can be
optimally learned end-to-end together with learning the weights of the DNN. In
this paper, we propose the paradigm of {\em deep collective learning} which
aims to learn the weights of DNNs and the inputs to DNNs simultaneously for
given tasks. We note that collective learning has been implicitly but widely
used in natural language processing while it has almost never been studied in
computer vision. Consequently, we propose the lookup vision networks
(Lookup-VNets) as a solution to deep collective learning in computer vision.
This is achieved by associating each color in each channel with a vector in
lookup tables. As learning inputs in computer vision has almost never been
studied in the existing literature, we explore several aspects of this question
through varieties of experiments on image classification tasks. Experimental
results on four benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet,
and ImageNet (ILSVRC2012) have shown several surprising characteristics of
Lookup-VNets and have demonstrated the advantages and promise of Lookup-VNets
and deep collective learning.

"A Universal Prompting Strategy for Extracting Process Model Information
  from Natural Language Text using Large Language Models","  Over the past decade, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to the
extraction of information from textual process descriptions. Despite the
remarkable progress witnessed in natural language processing (NLP), information
extraction within the Business Process Management domain remains predominantly
reliant on rule-based systems and machine learning methodologies. Data scarcity
has so far prevented the successful application of deep learning techniques.
However, the rapid progress in generative large language models (LLMs) makes it
possible to solve many NLP tasks with very high quality without the need for
extensive data. Therefore, we systematically investigate the potential of LLMs
for extracting information from textual process descriptions, targeting the
detection of process elements such as activities and actors, and relations
between them. Using a heuristic algorithm, we demonstrate the suitability of
the extracted information for process model generation. Based on a novel
prompting strategy, we show that LLMs are able to outperform state-of-the-art
machine learning approaches with absolute performance improvements of up to 8\%
$F_1$ score across three different datasets. We evaluate our prompting strategy
on eight different LLMs, showing it is universally applicable, while also
analyzing the impact of certain prompt parts on extraction quality. The number
of example texts, the specificity of definitions, and the rigour of format
instructions are identified as key for improving the accuracy of extracted
information. Our code, prompts, and data are publicly available.

"One Deep Music Representation to Rule Them All? : A comparative analysis
  of different representation learning strategies","  Inspired by the success of deploying deep learning in the fields of Computer
Vision and Natural Language Processing, this learning paradigm has also found
its way into the field of Music Information Retrieval. In order to benefit from
deep learning in an effective, but also efficient manner, deep transfer
learning has become a common approach. In this approach, it is possible to
reuse the output of a pre-trained neural network as the basis for a new
learning task. The underlying hypothesis is that if the initial and new
learning tasks show commonalities and are applied to the same type of input
data (e.g. music audio), the generated deep representation of the data is also
informative for the new task. Since, however, most of the networks used to
generate deep representations are trained using a single initial learning
source, their representation is unlikely to be informative for all possible
future tasks. In this paper, we present the results of our investigation of
what are the most important factors to generate deep representations for the
data and learning tasks in the music domain. We conducted this investigation
via an extensive empirical study that involves multiple learning sources, as
well as multiple deep learning architectures with varying levels of information
sharing between sources, in order to learn music representations. We then
validate these representations considering multiple target datasets for
evaluation. The results of our experiments yield several insights on how to
approach the design of methods for learning widely deployable deep data
representations in the music domain.

integrated with a procedure of unsupervised learning of representations by
maximizing the mutual information between text matching neural network's input

representations. We evaluate our text matching approach on several tasks
including natural language inference, paraphrase identification, and answer

"Detecting ESG topics using domain-specific language models and data

natural language processing (NLP) tasks in the financial domain remain
challenging due to the paucity of appropriately labelled data. Other issues
that can limit task performance are differences in word distribution between
the general corpora - typically used to pre-train language models - and
financial corpora, which often exhibit specialized language and symbology.
Here, we investigate two approaches that may help to mitigate these issues.
Firstly, we experiment with further language model pre-training using large
amounts of in-domain data from business and financial news. We then apply
augmentation approaches to increase the size of our dataset for model

EnSyth: A Pruning Approach to Synthesis of Deep Learning Ensembles,"  Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-art performance in many domains
including computer vision, natural language processing and self-driving cars.
However, they are very computationally expensive and memory intensive which
raises significant challenges when it comes to deploy or train them on strict
latency applications or resource-limited environments. As a result, many
attempts have been introduced to accelerate and compress deep learning models,
however the majority were not able to maintain the same accuracy of the

approach to enhance the predictability of compact neural network's models.
First, we generate a set of diverse compressed deep learning models using
different hyperparameters for a pruning method, after that we utilise ensemble
learning to synthesise the outputs of the compressed models to compose a new
pool of classifiers. Finally, we apply backward elimination on the generated
pool to explore the best performing combinations of models. On CIFAR-10,

"MessageNet: Message Classification using Natural Language Processing and
  Meta-data","  In this paper we propose a new Deep Learning (DL) approach for message
classification. Our method is based on the state-of-the-art Natural Language
Processing (NLP) building blocks, combined with a novel technique for infusing
the meta-data input that is typically available in messages such as the sender
information, timestamps, attached image, audio, affiliations, and more. As we
demonstrate throughout the paper, going beyond the mere text by leveraging all
available channels in the message, could yield an improved representation and
higher classification accuracy. To achieve message representation, each type of
input is processed in a dedicated block in the neural network architecture that
is suitable for the data type. Such an implementation enables training all
blocks together simultaneously, and forming cross channels features in the
network. We show in the Experiments Section that in some cases, message's
meta-data holds an additional information that cannot be extracted just from
the text, and when using this information we achieve better performance.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our multi-modality block approach outperforms
other approaches for injecting the meta data to the the text classifier.

Training Larger Networks for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"  The success of deep learning in the computer vision and natural language
processing communities can be attributed to training of very deep neural
networks with millions or billions of parameters which can then be trained with
massive amounts of data. However, similar trend has largely eluded training of
deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms where larger networks do not lead
to performance improvement. Previous work has shown that this is mostly due to
instability during training of deep RL agents when using larger networks. In
this paper, we make an attempt to understand and address training of larger
networks for deep RL. We first show that naively increasing network capacity
does not improve performance. Then, we propose a novel method that consists of
1) wider networks with DenseNet connection, 2) decoupling representation
learning from training of RL, 3) a distributed training method to mitigate
overfitting problems. Using this three-fold technique, we show that we can
train very large networks that result in significant performance gains. We
present several ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method and some intuitive understanding of the reasons for performance gain. We
show that our proposed method outperforms other baseline algorithms on several
challenging locomotion tasks.

A Survey on Uncertainty Quantification Methods for Deep Learning,"  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in making
accurate predictions for computer vision, natural language processing, as well
as science and engineering domains. However, it is also well-recognized that
DNNs sometimes make unexpected, incorrect, but overconfident predictions. This
can cause serious consequences in high-stake applications, such as autonomous
driving, medical diagnosis, and disaster response. Uncertainty quantification
(UQ) aims to estimate the confidence of DNN predictions beyond prediction
accuracy. In recent years, many UQ methods have been developed for DNNs. It is
of great practical value to systematically categorize these UQ methods and
compare their advantages and disadvantages. However, existing surveys mostly
focus on categorizing UQ methodologies from a neural network architecture
perspective or a Bayesian perspective and ignore the source of uncertainty that
each methodology can incorporate, making it difficult to select an appropriate
UQ method in practice. To fill the gap, this paper presents a systematic
taxonomy of UQ methods for DNNs based on the types of uncertainty sources (data
uncertainty versus model uncertainty). We summarize the advantages and
disadvantages of methods in each category. We show how our taxonomy of UQ
methodologies can potentially help guide the choice of UQ method in different
machine learning problems (e.g., active learning, robustness, and reinforcement

Hopular: Modern Hopfield Networks for Tabular Data,"  While Deep Learning excels in structured data as encountered in vision and
natural language processing, it failed to meet its expectations on tabular
data. For tabular data, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, and
Gradient Boosting are the best performing techniques with Gradient Boosting in
the lead. Recently, we saw a surge of Deep Learning methods that were tailored
to tabular data but still underperform compared to Gradient Boosting on
small-sized datasets. We suggest ""Hopular"", a novel Deep Learning architecture
for medium- and small-sized datasets, where each layer is equipped with
continuous modern Hopfield networks. The modern Hopfield networks use stored
data to identify feature-feature, feature-target, and sample-sample
dependencies. Hopular's novelty is that every layer can directly access the
original input as well as the whole training set via stored data in the
Hopfield networks. Therefore, Hopular can step-wise update its current model
and the resulting prediction at every layer like standard iterative learning
algorithms. In experiments on small-sized tabular datasets with less than 1,000
samples, Hopular surpasses Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, SVMs, and in
particular several Deep Learning methods. In experiments on medium-sized
tabular data with about 10,000 samples, Hopular outperforms XGBoost, CatBoost,

A New Method for Cross-Lingual-based Semantic Role Labeling,"  Semantic role labeling is a crucial task in natural language processing,
enabling better comprehension of natural language. However, the lack of
annotated data in multiple languages has posed a challenge for researchers. To
address this, a deep learning algorithm based on model transfer has been
proposed. The algorithm utilizes a dataset consisting of the English portion of
CoNLL2009 and a corpus of semantic roles in Persian. To optimize the efficiency
of training, only ten percent of the educational data from each language is
used. The results of the proposed model demonstrate significant improvements
compared to Niksirt et al.'s model. In monolingual mode, the proposed model
achieved a 2.05 percent improvement on F1-score, while in cross-lingual mode,
the improvement was even more substantial, reaching 6.23 percent. Worth noting
is that the compared model only trained two of the four stages of semantic role
labeling and employed golden data for the remaining two stages. This suggests
that the actual superiority of the proposed model surpasses the reported
numbers by a significant margin. The development of cross-lingual methods for
semantic role labeling holds promise, particularly in addressing the scarcity
of annotated data for various languages. These advancements pave the way for
further research in understanding and processing natural language across
different linguistic contexts.

"Emulating Spatio-Temporal Realizations of Three-Dimensional Isotropic

using cutting-edge Deep Learning techniques. The deep learning framework
incorporates physical constraints on the flow, such as preserving
incompressibility and global statistical invariants of velocity gradient
tensor. The accuracy of the model is assessed using statistical and
physics-based metrics. The data set comes from Direct Numerical Simulation of
an incompressible, statistically stationary, isotropic turbulent flow in a
cubic box. Since the size of the dataset is memory intensive, we first generate
a low-dimensional representation of the velocity data, and then pass it to a
sequence prediction network that learns the spatial and temporal correlations
of the underlying data. The dimensionality reduction is performed via
extraction using Vector-Quantized Autoencoder (VQ-AE), which learns the
discrete latent variables. For the sequence forecasting, the idea of
Transformer architecture from natural language processing is used, and its
performance compared against more standard Recurrent Networks (such as
Convolutional LSTM). These architectures are designed and trained to perform a
sequence to sequence multi-class classification task in which they take an
input sequence with a fixed length (k) and predict a sequence with a fixed
length (p), representing the future time instants of the flow. Our results for
the short-term predictions show that the accuracy of results for both models
deteriorates across predicted snapshots due to autoregressive nature of the
predictions. Based on our diagnostics tests, the trained Conv-Transformer model
outperforms the Conv-LSTM one and can accurately, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, retain the large scales and capture well the inertial scales of
flow but fails at recovering the small and intermittent fluid motions.

For TRACER, the trust region helps to control the learning step size and avoid

"What makes a language easy to deep-learn? Deep neural networks and

representations directly from raw character sequences by training a Simple
recurrent Network to predict the next character in text. The network uses its
hidden layer to evolve abstract representations of the character sequences it
sees. To demonstrate the usefulness of the learned text embeddings, we use them
as features in a supervised character level text segmentation and labeling
task: recognizing spans of text containing programming language code. By using
the embeddings as features we are able to substantially improve over a baseline

"Continually Learn to Map Visual Concepts to Large Language Models in

deep learning, even more so when working in resource-constrained environments

supervised learning are often prone to overfitting, catastrophic forgetting,
and biased representations. On the other hand, large language models contain
knowledge about multiple concepts and their relations, which can foster a more
robust, informed and coherent learning process. This work proposes Continual
Visual Mapping (CVM), an approach that continually ground vision
representations to a knowledge space extracted from a fixed Language model.
Specifically, CVM continually trains a small and efficient visual model to map
its representations into a conceptual space established by a fixed Large
Language Model. Due to their smaller nature, CVM can be used when directly
adapting large visual pre-trained models is unfeasible due to computational or

Word Embedding based Edit Distance,"  Text similarity calculation is a fundamental problem in natural language
processing and related fields. In recent years, deep neural networks have been
developed to perform the task and high performances have been achieved. The
neural networks are usually trained with labeled data in supervised learning,
and creation of labeled data is usually very costly. In this short paper, we
address unsupervised learning for text similarity calculation. We propose a new
method called Word Embedding based Edit Distance (WED), which incorporates word
embedding into edit distance. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show WED
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods including edit distance,
TF-IDF based cosine, word embedding based cosine, Jaccard index, etc.

"Improving a neural network model by explanation-guided training for
  glioma classification based on MRI data","  In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) systems have come to the
forefront. These systems, mostly based on Deep learning (DL), achieve excellent
results in areas such as image processing, natural language processing, or
speech recognition. Despite the statistically high accuracy of deep learning
models, their output is often a decision of ""black box"". Thus, Interpretability
methods have become a popular way to gain insight into the decision-making
process of deep learning models. Explanation of a deep learning model is
desirable in the medical domain since the experts have to justify their
judgments to the patient. In this work, we proposed a method for
explanation-guided training that uses a Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP)
technique to force the model to focus only on the relevant part of the image.
We experimentally verified our method on a convolutional neural network (CNN)
model for low-grade and high-grade glioma classification problems. Our
experiments show promising results in a way to use interpretation techniques in
the model training process.

research. Within molecular science, it is revolutionizing the traditional
computer-aided paradigm, ushering in a new era of deep learning. With recent
progress in multimodal learning and natural language processing, an emerging
trend has targeted at building multimodal frameworks to jointly model molecules
with textual domain knowledge. In this paper, we present the first systematic
survey on multimodal frameworks for molecules research. Specifically,we begin
with the development of molecular deep learning and point out the necessity to
involve textual modality. Next, we focus on recent advances in text-molecule
alignment methods, categorizing current models into two groups based on their
architectures and listing relevant pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we delves
into the utilization of large language models and prompting techniques for
molecular tasks and present significant applications in drug discovery.
Finally, we discuss the limitations in this field and highlight several

"Categorization in the Wild: Generalizing Cognitive Models to
  Naturalistic Data across Languages","  Categories such as animal or furniture are acquired at an early age and play
an important role in processing, organizing, and communicating world knowledge.
Categories exist across cultures: they allow to efficiently represent the
complexity of the world, and members of a community strongly agree on their
nature, revealing a shared mental representation. Models of category learning
and representation, however, are typically tested on data from small-scale
experiments involving small sets of concepts with artificially restricted
features; and experiments predominantly involve participants of selected
cultural and socio-economical groups (very often involving western native
speakers of English such as U.S. college students) . This work investigates
whether models of categorization generalize (a) to rich and noisy data
approximating the environment humans live in; and (b) across languages and
cultures. We present a Bayesian cognitive model designed to jointly learn
categories and their structured representation from natural language text which
allows us to (a) evaluate performance on a large scale, and (b) apply our model
to a diverse set of languages. We show that meaningful categories comprising
hundreds of concepts and richly structured featural representations emerge
across languages. Our work illustrates the potential of recent advances in
computational modeling and large scale naturalistic datasets for cognitive
science research.

MMREC: LLM Based Multi-Modal Recommender System,"  The importance of recommender systems is growing rapidly due to the
exponential increase in the volume of content generated daily. This surge in
content presents unique challenges for designing effective recommender systems.
Key among these challenges is the need to effectively leverage the vast amounts
of natural language data and images that represent user preferences. This paper
presents a novel approach to enhancing recommender systems by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning techniques. The proposed framework
aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of recommendations by incorporating
multi-modal information processing and by the use of unified latent space
representation. The study explores the potential of LLMs to better understand
and utilize natural language data in recommendation contexts, addressing the
limitations of previous methods. The framework efficiently extracts and
integrates text and image information through LLMs, unifying diverse modalities
in a latent space to simplify the learning process for the ranking model.
Experimental results demonstrate the enhanced discriminative power of the model
when utilizing multi-modal information. This research contributes to the
evolving field of recommender systems by showcasing the potential of LLMs and
multi-modal data integration to create more personalized and contextually
relevant recommendations.

"Reverse Transfer Learning: Can Word Embeddings Trained for Different NLP
  Tasks Improve Neural Language Models?","  Natural language processing (NLP) tasks tend to suffer from a paucity of
suitably annotated training data, hence the recent success of transfer learning
across a wide variety of them. The typical recipe involves: (i) training a
deep, possibly bidirectional, neural network with an objective related to
language modeling, for which training data is plentiful; and (ii) using the
trained network to derive contextual representations that are far richer than
standard linear word embeddings such as word2vec, and thus result in important
gains. In this work, we wonder whether the opposite perspective is also true:
can contextual representations trained for different NLP tasks improve language
modeling itself? Since language models (LMs) are predominantly locally
optimized, other NLP tasks may help them make better predictions based on the
entire semantic fabric of a document. We test the performance of several types
of pre-trained embeddings in neural LMs, and we investigate whether it is
possible to make the LM more aware of global semantic information through
embeddings pre-trained with a domain classification model. Initial experiments
suggest that as long as the proper objective criterion is used during training,
pre-trained embeddings are likely to be beneficial for neural language
modeling.

"ParticleGrid: Enabling Deep Learning using 3D Representation of
  Materials","  From AlexNet to Inception, autoencoders to diffusion models, the development
of novel and powerful deep learning models and learning algorithms has
proceeded at breakneck speeds. In part, we believe that rapid iteration of
model architecture and learning techniques by a large community of researchers
over a common representation of the underlying entities has resulted in
transferable deep learning knowledge. As a result, model scale, accuracy,
fidelity, and compute performance have dramatically increased in computer
vision and natural language processing. On the other hand, the lack of a common
representation for chemical structure has hampered similar progress. To enable
transferable deep learning, we identify the need for a robust 3-dimensional
representation of materials such as molecules and crystals. The goal is to
enable both materials property prediction and materials generation with 3D
structures. While computationally costly, such representations can model a
large set of chemical structures. We propose $\textit{ParticleGrid}$, a
SIMD-optimized library for 3D structures, that is designed for deep learning
applications and to seamlessly integrate with deep learning frameworks. Our
highly optimized grid generation allows for generating grids on the fly on the
CPU, reducing storage and GPU compute and memory requirements. We show the
efficacy of 3D grids generated via $\textit{ParticleGrid}$ and accurately
predict molecular energy properties using a 3D convolutional neural network.

"Deep Learning -- A first Meta-Survey of selected Reviews across
  Scientific Disciplines, their Commonalities, Challenges and Research Impact","  Deep learning belongs to the field of artificial intelligence, where machines
perform tasks that typically require some kind of human intelligence. Similar
to the basic structure of a brain, a deep learning algorithm consists of an
artificial neural network, which resembles the biological brain structure.
Mimicking the learning process of humans with their senses, deep learning
networks are fed with (sensory) data, like texts, images, videos or sounds.
These networks outperform the state-of-the-art methods in different tasks and,
because of this, the whole field saw an exponential growth during the last
years. This growth resulted in way over 10,000 publications per year in the
last years. For example, the search engine PubMed alone, which covers only a
sub-set of all publications in the medical field, provides already over 11,000
results in Q3 2020 for the search term 'deep learning', and around 90% of these
results are from the last three years. Consequently, a complete overview over
the field of deep learning is already impossible to obtain and, in the near
future, it will potentially become difficult to obtain an overview over a
subfield. However, there are several review articles about deep learning, which
are focused on specific scientific fields or applications, for example deep
learning advances in computer vision or in specific tasks like object
detection. With these surveys as a foundation, the aim of this contribution is
to provide a first high-level, categorized meta-survey of selected reviews on
deep learning across different scientific disciplines. The categories (computer
vision, language processing, medical informatics and additional works) have

"iReason: Multimodal Commonsense Reasoning using Videos and Natural
  Language with Interpretability","  Causality knowledge is vital to building robust AI systems. Deep learning
models often perform poorly on tasks that require causal reasoning, which is
often derived using some form of commonsense knowledge not immediately
available in the input but implicitly inferred by humans. Prior work has
unraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence
of causality. While language representation models preserve contextual
knowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships
during training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an
existing model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene
understanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better
performance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring
about. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task
of mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However,
there does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by
juxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and
easy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are
denser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information
offers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a
framework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos
and natural language captions. Furthermore, iReason's architecture integrates a
causal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error
analysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using
a two-pronged comparative analysis with language representation learning models

Human Cognition and Language Processing with Neural-Lexicon Hypothesis,"  Cognition and language seem closely related to the human cognitive process,
although they have not been studied and investigated in detail. Our brain is
too complex to fully comprehend the structures and connectivity, as well as its
functions, with the currently available technology such as
electro-encephalography, positron emission tomography, or functional magnetic
resonance imaging, and neurobiological data. Therefore, the exploration of
neurobiological processes, such as cognition, requires substantially more
related evidences, especially from in-vivo human experiments. Cognition and
language are of inter-disciplinary nature and additional methodological support
is needed from other disciplines, such as deep learning in the field of
artificial intelligence, for example. In this paper, we have attempted to
explain the neural mechanisms underlying ""cognition and language processing"" or
""cognition or thinking"" using a novel neural network model with several newly
emerging developments such as neuronal resonance, in-vivo human fiber
tractography or connectivity data, Engram and Hebbian hypothesis, human memory
formation in the high brain areas, deep learning, and more recently developed
neural memory concepts, the neural lexicon. The neural lexicon is developed via
language by repeated exposure to the neural system, similar to multilayer
signal processing in deep learning. We have derived a neural model to explain
how human ""cognition and language processing"" or ""cognition and thinking""
works, with a focus on language, a universal medium of the human society.
Although the proposed hypothesis is not fully based on experimental evidences,
a substantial portion of the observations in this study is directly and
indirectly supported by recent experimental findings and the theoretical bases

"Leveraging Large Language Models for Wireless Symbol Detection via
  In-Context Learning","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant strides in tackling
challenging tasks in wireless systems, especially when an accurate wireless
model is not available. However, when available data is limited, traditional

whether and how LLMs can benefit challenging non-language tasks in wireless

data regime without any training or fine-tuning, unlike DNNs which require
training. We further demonstrate that the performance of LLMs varies
significantly when employed with different prompt templates. To solve this

using LLMs via ICL methods generally outperforms traditional DNNs on the symbol
demodulation task and yields highly confident predictions when coupled with

  As weighted automata compute linear functions, they are computationally more
efficient than neural networks and thus the nature of the approach is the one
of knowledge distillation. We detail experiments on 62 data sets (both
synthetic and from real-world applications) that allow an in-depth study of the

Therefore, we innovatively design an advanced multimodal deep learning

Therefore, there are only a few machine-learning-based extraction approaches.

rarely distinguish relevant and irrelevant information in textual descriptions.
In this paper, we present GUIDO, a hybrid approach to the process model
extraction task that first, classifies sentences regarding their relevance to
the process model, using a BERT-based sentence classifier, and second, extracts
a process model from the sentences classified as relevant, using dependency
parsing. The presented approach achieves significantly better results than a

cases. Such deep learners can be trained from additional information obtained
from simulated results and by enforcing the physical laws of the chaotic
systems. This paper considers extreme events and their dynamics and proposes
elegant models based on deep neural networks, called knowledge-based deep
learning (KDL). Our proposed KDL can learn the complex patterns governing
chaotic systems by jointly training on real and simulated data directly from
the dynamics and their differential equations. This knowledge is transferred to
model and forecast real-world chaotic events exhibiting extreme behavior. We
validate the efficiency of our model by assessing it on three real-world
benchmark datasets: El Nino sea surface temperature, San Juan Dengue viral
infection, and Bj{\o}rn{\o}ya daily precipitation, all governed by extreme
events' dynamics. Using prior knowledge of extreme events and physics-based
loss functions to lead the neural network learning, we ensure physically
consistent, generalizable, and accurate forecasting, even in a small data
regime.

"Multi-task learning for natural language processing in the 2020s: where
  are we going?","  Multi-task learning (MTL) significantly pre-dates the deep learning era, and
it has seen a resurgence in the past few years as researchers have been
applying MTL to deep learning solutions for natural language tasks. While
steady MTL research has always been present, there is a growing interest driven
by the impressive successes published in the related fields of transfer
learning and pre-training, such as BERT, and the release of new challenge
problems, such as GLUE and the NLP Decathlon (decaNLP). These efforts place
more focus on how weights are shared across networks, evaluate the re-usability
of network components and identify use cases where MTL can significantly
outperform single-task solutions. This paper strives to provide a comprehensive
survey of the numerous recent MTL contributions to the field of natural
language processing and provide a forum to focus efforts on the hardest
unsolved problems in the next decade. While novel models that improve
performance on NLP benchmarks are continually produced, lasting MTL challenges
remain unsolved which could hold the key to better language understanding,
knowledge discovery and natural language interfaces.

Semi-supervised Interactive Intent Labeling,"  Building the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules of task-oriented
Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) involves a definition of intents and entities,
collection of task-relevant data, annotating the data with intents and
entities, and then repeating the same process over and over again for adding
any functionality/enhancement to the SDS. In this work, we showcase an Intent
Bulk Labeling system where SDS developers can interactively label and augment
training data from unlabeled utterance corpora using advanced clustering and
visual labeling methods. We extend the Deep Aligned Clustering work with a
better backbone BERT model, explore techniques to select the seed data for
labeling, and develop a data balancing method using an oversampling technique
that utilizes paraphrasing models. We also look at the effect of data
augmentation on the clustering process. Our results show that we can achieve
over 10% gain in clustering accuracy on some datasets using the combination of
the above techniques. Finally, we extract utterance embeddings from the
clustering model and plot the data to interactively bulk label the samples,
reducing the time and effort for data labeling of the whole dataset
significantly.

BabyBear: Cheap inference triage for expensive language models,"  Transformer language models provide superior accuracy over previous models
but they are computationally and environmentally expensive. Borrowing the
concept of model cascading from computer vision, we introduce BabyBear, a
framework for cascading models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks to
minimize cost. The core strategy is inference triage, exiting early when the
least expensive model in the cascade achieves a sufficiently high-confidence
prediction. We test BabyBear on several open source data sets related to
document classification and entity recognition. We find that for common NLP
tasks a high proportion of the inference load can be accomplished with cheap,
fast models that have learned by observing a deep learning model. This allows
us to reduce the compute cost of large-scale classification jobs by more than
50% while retaining overall accuracy. For named entity recognition, we save 33%
of the deep learning compute while maintaining an F1 score higher than 95% on
the CoNLL benchmark.

"Training point-based deep learning networks for forest segmentation with
  synthetic data","  Remote sensing through unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has been increasing in
forestry in recent years, along with using machine learning for data
processing. Deep learning architectures, extensively applied in natural
language and image processing, have recently been extended to the point cloud
domain. However, the availability of point cloud datasets for training and
testing remains limited. Creating forested environment point cloud datasets is
expensive, requires high-precision sensors, and is time-consuming as manual
point classification is required. Moreover, forest areas could be inaccessible
or dangerous for humans, further complicating data collection. Then, a question
arises whether it is possible to use synthetic data to train deep learning
networks without the need to rely on large volumes of real forest data. To
answer this question, we developed a realistic simulator that procedurally
generates synthetic forest scenes. Thanks to this, we have conducted a
comparative study of different state-of-the-art point-based deep learning
networks for forest segmentation. Using created datasets, we determined the
feasibility of using synthetic data to train deep learning networks to classify
point clouds from real forest datasets. Both the simulator and the datasets are
released as part of this work.

"Automatic coding of students' writing via Contrastive Representation
  Learning in the Wasserstein space","  Qualitative analysis of verbal data is of central importance in the learning
sciences. It is labor-intensive and time-consuming, however, which limits the
amount of data researchers can include in studies. This work is a step towards
building a statistical machine learning (ML) method for achieving an automated
support for qualitative analyses of students' writing, here specifically in
score laboratory reports in introductory biology for sophistication of
argumentation and reasoning. We start with a set of lab reports from an
undergraduate biology course, scored by a four-level scheme that considers the
complexity of argument structure, the scope of evidence, and the care and
nuance of conclusions. Using this set of labeled data, we show that a popular
natural language modeling processing pipeline, namely vector representation of
words, a.k.a word embeddings, followed by Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model
for capturing language generation as a state-space model, is able to
quantitatively capture the scoring, with a high Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)
prediction score, when trained in via a novel contrastive learning set-up. We
show that the ML algorithm approached the inter-rater reliability of human
analysis. Ultimately, we conclude, that machine learning (ML) for natural
language processing (NLP) holds promise for assisting learning sciences
researchers in conducting qualitative studies at much larger scales than is
currently possible.

"Using Trusted Data to Train Deep Networks on Labels Corrupted by Severe
  Noise","  The growing importance of massive datasets used for deep learning makes
robustness to label noise a critical property for classifiers to have. Sources
of label noise include automatic labeling, non-expert labeling, and label
corruption by data poisoning adversaries. Numerous previous works assume that
no source of labels can be trusted. We relax this assumption and assume that a
small subset of the training data is trusted. This enables substantial label
corruption robustness performance gains. In addition, particularly severe label
noise can be combated by using a set of trusted data with clean labels. We
utilize trusted data by proposing a loss correction technique that utilizes
trusted examples in a data-efficient manner to mitigate the effects of label
noise on deep neural network classifiers. Across vision and natural language
processing tasks, we experiment with various label noises at several strengths,
and show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods.

"STA: Self-controlled Text Augmentation for Improving Text
  Classifications","  Despite recent advancements in Machine Learning, many tasks still involve
working in low-data regimes which can make solving natural language problems
difficult. Recently, a number of text augmentation techniques have emerged in
the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which can enrich the training
data with new examples, though they are not without their caveats. For
instance, simple rule-based heuristic methods are effective, but lack variation
in semantic content and syntactic structure with respect to the original text.
On the other hand, more complex deep learning approaches can cause extreme
shifts in the intrinsic meaning of the text and introduce unwanted noise into
the training data. To more reliably control the quality of the augmented
examples, we introduce a state-of-the-art approach for Self-Controlled Text
Augmentation (STA). Our approach tightly controls the generation process by
introducing a self-checking procedure to ensure that generated examples retain
the semantic content of the original text. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarking datasets demonstrate that STA substantially outperforms existing
state-of-the-art techniques, whilst qualitative analysis reveals that the
generated examples are both lexically diverse and semantically reliable.

"An Uncertainty-aware Deep Learning Framework-based Robust Design
  Optimization of Metamaterial Units","  Mechanical metamaterials represent an innovative class of artificial
structures, distinguished by their extraordinary mechanical characteristics,
which are beyond the scope of traditional natural materials. The use of deep
generative models has become increasingly popular in the design of metamaterial
units. The effectiveness of using deep generative models lies in their capacity
to compress complex input data into a simplified, lower-dimensional latent
space, while also enabling the creation of novel optimal designs through
sampling within this space. However, the design process does not take into
account the effect of model uncertainty due to data sparsity or the effect of
input data uncertainty due to inherent randomness in the data. This might lead
to the generation of undesirable structures with high sensitivity to the
uncertainties in the system. To address this issue, a novel uncertainty-aware
deep learning framework-based robust design approach is proposed for the design
of metamaterial units with optimal target properties. The proposed approach
utilizes the probabilistic nature of the deep learning framework and quantifies
both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties associated with surrogate-based
design optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed design approach is
capable of designing high-performance metamaterial units with high reliability.
To showcase the effectiveness of the proposed design approach, a
single-objective design optimization problem and a multi-objective design
optimization problem are presented. The optimal robust designs obtained are
validated by comparing them to the designs obtained from the topology
optimization method as well as the designs obtained from a deterministic deep
learning framework-based design optimization where none of the uncertainties in
the system are explicitly considered.

normalization) from a statistical point of view. Along the way, we highlight
new characteristics of deep learning (including depth and over-parametrization)

results on theories of deep learning, many of which are only suggestive. While
a complete understanding of deep learning remains elusive, we hope that our

Deep Active Learning for Data Mining from Conflict Text Corpora,"  High-resolution event data on armed conflict and related processes have
revolutionized the study of political contention with datasets like UCDP GED,

Active learning is employed to then step-wise train (fine-tuning) of a large,

"Deep Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: A Review of Recent Advances and
  Perspectives","  Deep learning has become the method of choice to tackle real-world problems
in different domains, partly because of its ability to learn from data and
achieve impressive performance on a wide range of applications. However, its
success usually relies on two assumptions: (i) vast troves of labeled datasets
are required for accurate model fitting, and (ii) training and testing data are
independent and identically distributed. Its performance on unseen target
domains, thus, is not guaranteed, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution data at the adaptation stage. The performance drop on data
in a target domain is a critical problem in deploying deep neural networks that
are successfully trained on data in a source domain. Unsupervised domain

Language Semantic Graph Guided Data-Efficient Learning,"  Developing generalizable models that can effectively learn from limited data
and with minimal reliance on human supervision is a significant objective
within the machine learning community, particularly in the era of deep neural
networks. Therefore, to achieve data-efficient learning, researchers typically
explore approaches that can leverage more related or unlabeled data without
necessitating additional manual labeling efforts, such as Semi-Supervised
Learning (SSL), Transfer Learning (TL), and Data Augmentation (DA). SSL
leverages unlabeled data in the training process, while TL enables the transfer
of expertise from related data distributions. DA broadens the dataset by
synthesizing new data from existing examples. However, the significance of
additional knowledge contained within labels has been largely overlooked in
research. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on data efficiency that
involves exploiting the semantic information contained in the labels of the
available data. Specifically, we introduce a Language Semantic Graph (LSG)
which is constructed from labels manifest as natural language descriptions.
Upon this graph, an auxiliary graph neural network is trained to extract
high-level semantic relations and then used to guide the training of the
primary model, enabling more adequate utilization of label knowledge. Across
image, video, and audio modalities, we utilize the LSG method in both TL and

"DataAgent: Evaluating Large Language Models' Ability to Answer
  Zero-Shot, Natural Language Queries","  Conventional processes for analyzing datasets and extracting meaningful
information are often time-consuming and laborious. Previous work has
identified manual, repetitive coding and data collection as major obstacles
that hinder data scientists from undertaking more nuanced labor and high-level
projects. To combat this, we evaluated OpenAI's GPT-3.5 as a ""Language Data
Scientist"" (LDS) that can extrapolate key findings, including correlations and
basic information, from a given dataset. The model was tested on a diverse set
of benchmark datasets to evaluate its performance across multiple standards,
including data science code-generation based tasks involving libraries such as
NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow, and was broadly successful in
correctly answering a given data science query related to the benchmark
dataset. The LDS used various novel prompt engineering techniques to
effectively answer a given question, including Chain-of-Thought reinforcement
and SayCan prompt engineering. Our findings demonstrate great potential for
leveraging Large Language Models for low-level, zero-shot data analysis.

"Enable Deep Learning on Mobile Devices: Methods, Systems, and
  Applications","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved unprecedented success in the field
of artificial intelligence (AI), including computer vision, natural language
processing and speech recognition. However, their superior performance comes at
the considerable cost of computational complexity, which greatly hinders their
applications in many resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones and
Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, methods and techniques that are
able to lift the efficiency bottleneck while preserving the high accuracy of
DNNs are in great demand in order to enable numerous edge AI applications. This
paper provides an overview of efficient deep learning methods, systems and
applications. We start from introducing popular model compression methods,
including pruning, factorization, quantization as well as compact model design.
To reduce the large design cost of these manual solutions, we discuss the
AutoML framework for each of them, such as neural architecture search (NAS) and
automated pruning and quantization. We then cover efficient on-device training
to enable user customization based on the local data on mobile devices. Apart
from general acceleration techniques, we also showcase several task-specific
accelerations for point cloud, video and natural language processing by
exploiting their spatial sparsity and temporal/token redundancy. Finally, to
support all these algorithmic advancements, we introduce the efficient deep
learning system design from both software and hardware perspectives.

Multi-Task Learning in Natural Language Processing: An Overview,"  Deep learning approaches have achieved great success in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, directly training deep neural models often
suffer from overfitting and data scarcity problems that are pervasive in NLP
tasks. In recent years, Multi-Task Learning (MTL), which can leverage useful
information of related tasks to achieve simultaneous performance improvement on
these tasks, has been used to handle these problems. In this paper, we give an
overview of the use of MTL in NLP tasks. We first review MTL architectures used
in NLP tasks and categorize them into four classes, including parallel
architecture, hierarchical architecture, modular architecture, and generative
adversarial architecture. Then we present optimization techniques on loss
construction, gradient regularization, data sampling, and task scheduling to
properly train a multi-task model. After presenting applications of MTL in a
variety of NLP tasks, we introduce some benchmark datasets. Finally, we make a
conclusion and discuss several possible research directions in this field.

"The Vulnerability of the Neural Networks Against Adversarial Examples in
  Deep Learning Algorithms","  With further development in the fields of computer vision, network security,
natural language processing and so on so forth, deep learning technology
gradually exposed certain security risks. The existing deep learning algorithms
cannot effectively describe the essential characteristics of data, making the

Based on current security threats faced by deep learning, this paper introduces
the problem of adversarial examples in deep learning, sorts out the existing
attack and defense methods of the black box and white box, and classifies them.
It briefly describes the application of some adversarial examples in different
scenarios in recent years, compares several defense technologies of adversarial
examples, and finally summarizes the problems in this research field and
prospects for its future development. This paper introduces the common white
box attack methods in detail, and further compares the similarities and
differences between the attack of the black and white box. Correspondingly, the
author also introduces the defense methods, and analyzes the performance of
these methods against the black and white box attack.

"Word class representations spontaneously emerge in a deep neural network
  trained on next word prediction","  How do humans learn language, and can the first language be learned at all?
These fundamental questions are still hotly debated. In contemporary
linguistics, there are two major schools of thought that give completely
opposite answers. According to Chomsky's theory of universal grammar, language
cannot be learned because children are not exposed to sufficient data in their
linguistic environment. In contrast, usage-based models of language assume a
profound relationship between language structure and language use. In
particular, contextual mental processing and mental representations are assumed
to have the cognitive capacity to capture the complexity of actual language use
at all levels. The prime example is syntax, i.e., the rules by which words are
assembled into larger units such as sentences. Typically, syntactic rules are
expressed as sequences of word classes. However, it remains unclear whether
word classes are innate, as implied by universal grammar, or whether they
emerge during language acquisition, as suggested by usage-based approaches.
Here, we address this issue from a machine learning and natural language
processing perspective. In particular, we trained an artificial deep neural
network on predicting the next word, provided sequences of consecutive words as
input. Subsequently, we analyzed the emerging activation patterns in the hidden
layers of the neural network. Strikingly, we find that the internal
representations of nine-word input sequences cluster according to the word
class of the tenth word to be predicted as output, even though the neural
network did not receive any explicit information about syntactic rules or word
classes during training. This surprising result suggests, that also in the
human brain, abstract representational categories such as word classes may
naturally emerge as a consequence of predictive coding and processing during
language acquisition.

GPT-3 Models are Poor Few-Shot Learners in the Biomedical Domain,"  Deep neural language models have set new breakthroughs in many tasks of
Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recent work has shown that deep transformer
language models (pretrained on large amounts of texts) can achieve high levels
of task-specific few-shot performance comparable to state-of-the-art models.
However, the ability of these large language models in few-shot transfer
learning has not yet been explored in the biomedical domain. We investigated
the performance of two powerful transformer language models, i.e. GPT-3 and
BioBERT, in few-shot settings on various biomedical NLP tasks. The experimental
results showed that, to a great extent, both the models underperform a language
model fine-tuned on the full training data. Although GPT-3 had already achieved
near state-of-the-art results in few-shot knowledge transfer on open-domain NLP
tasks, it could not perform as effectively as BioBERT, which is orders of
magnitude smaller than GPT-3. Regarding that BioBERT was already pretrained on
large biomedical text corpora, our study suggests that language models may
largely benefit from in-domain pretraining in task-specific few-shot learning.
However, in-domain pretraining seems not to be sufficient; novel pretraining
and few-shot learning strategies are required in the biomedical NLP domain.

Paraphrase Generation with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"  Automatic generation of paraphrases from a given sentence is an important yet
challenging task in natural language processing (NLP), and plays a key role in
a number of applications such as question answering, search, and dialogue. In
this paper, we present a deep reinforcement learning approach to paraphrase
generation. Specifically, we propose a new framework for the task, which
consists of a \textit{generator} and an \textit{evaluator}, both of which are
learned from data. The generator, built as a sequence-to-sequence learning
model, can produce paraphrases given a sentence. The evaluator, constructed as
a deep matching model, can judge whether two sentences are paraphrases of each
other. The generator is first trained by deep learning and then further
fine-tuned by reinforcement learning in which the reward is given by the
evaluator. For the learning of the evaluator, we propose two methods based on
supervised learning and inverse reinforcement learning respectively, depending
on the type of available training data. Empirical study shows that the learned
evaluator can guide the generator to produce more accurate paraphrases.
Experimental results demonstrate the proposed models (the generators)
outperform the state-of-the-art methods in paraphrase generation in both
automatic evaluation and human evaluation.

"Natural Language Processing in Electronic Health Records in Relation to
  Healthcare Decision-making: A Systematic Review","  Background: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used to extract
clinical insights from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, the lack of
annotated data, automated tools, and other challenges hinder the full
utilisation of NLP for EHRs. Various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL)
and NLP techniques are studied and compared to understand the limitations and
opportunities in this space comprehensively.
  Methodology: After screening 261 articles from 11 databases, we included 127
papers for full-text review covering seven categories of articles: 1) medical
note classification, 2) clinical entity recognition, 3) text summarisation, 4)
deep learning (DL) and transfer learning architecture, 5) information
extraction, 6) Medical language translation and 7) other NLP applications. This
study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
  Result and Discussion: EHR was the most commonly used data type among the
selected articles, and the datasets were primarily unstructured. Various ML and
DL methods were used, with prediction or classification being the most common
application of ML or DL. The most common use cases were: the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) classification, clinical
note analysis, and named entity recognition (NER) for clinical descriptions and
research on psychiatric disorders.
  Conclusion: We find that the adopted ML models were not adequately assessed.
In addition, the data imbalance problem is quite important, yet we must find
techniques to address this underlining problem. Future studies should address
key limitations in studies, primarily identifying Lupus Nephritis, Suicide
Attempts, perinatal self-harmed and ICD-9 classification.

"Background-aware Multi-source Fusion Financial Trend Forecasting
  Mechanism","  Stock prices, as an economic indicator, reflect changes in economic
development and market conditions. Traditional stock price prediction models
often only consider time-series data and are limited by the mechanisms of the
models themselves. Some deep learning models have high computational costs,
depend on a large amount of high-quality data, and have poor interpretations,
making it difficult to intuitively understand the driving factors behind the
predictions. Some studies have used deep learning models to extract text
features and combine them with price data to make joint predictions, but there
are issues with dealing with information noise, accurate extraction of text
sentiment, and how to efficiently fuse text and numerical data. To address
these issues in this paper, we propose a background-aware multi-source fusion
financial trend forecasting mechanism. The system leverages a large language
model to extract key information from policy and stock review texts, utilizing
the MacBERT model to generate feature vectors. These vectors are then
integrated with stock price data to form comprehensive feature representations.
These integrated features are input into a neural network comprising various
deep learning architectures. By integrating multiple data sources, the system
offers a holistic view of market dynamics. It harnesses the comprehensive
analytical and interpretative capabilities of large language models, retaining
deep semantic and sentiment information from policy texts to provide richer
input features for stock trend prediction. Additionally, we compare the
accuracy of six models (LSTM, BiLSTM, MogrifierLSTM, GRU, ST-LSTM, SwinLSTM).
The results demonstrate that our system achieves generally better accuracy in
predicting stock movements, attributed to the incorporation of large language
model processing, policy information, and other influential features.

However, most of the masking-based pre-trained language models are not designed
for generative design, and their black-box nature makes it difficult to

Deep Anomaly Detection with Outlier Exposure,"  It is important to detect anomalous inputs when deploying machine learning
systems. The use of larger and more complex inputs in deep learning magnifies
the difficulty of distinguishing between anomalous and in-distribution

enormous quantities. We propose leveraging these data to improve deep anomaly
detection by training anomaly detectors against an auxiliary dataset of
outliers, an approach we call Outlier Exposure (OE). This enables anomaly
detectors to generalize and detect unseen anomalies. In extensive experiments
on natural language processing and small- and large-scale vision tasks, we find
that Outlier Exposure significantly improves detection performance. We also
observe that cutting-edge generative models trained on CIFAR-10 may assign
higher likelihoods to SVHN images than to CIFAR-10 images; we use OE to
mitigate this issue. We also analyze the flexibility and robustness of Outlier
Exposure, and identify characteristics of the auxiliary dataset that improve

and trains the model to eliminate possible adversarial perturbations without
modifying the network architecture or adding extra data. Extensive experiments

Learning Unification-Based Natural Language Grammars,"  When parsing unrestricted language, wide-covering grammars often
undergenerate. Undergeneration can be tackled either by sentence correction, or
by grammar correction. This thesis concentrates upon automatic grammar
correction (or machine learning of grammar) as a solution to the problem of
undergeneration. Broadly speaking, grammar correction approaches can be
classified as being either {\it data-driven}, or {\it model-based}. Data-driven
learners use data-intensive methods to acquire grammar. They typically use
grammar formalisms unsuited to the needs of practical text processing and
cannot guarantee that the resulting grammar is adequate for subsequent semantic
interpretation. That is, data-driven learners acquire grammars that generate
strings that humans would judge to be grammatically ill-formed (they {\it
overgenerate}) and fail to assign linguistically plausible parses. Model-based
learners are knowledge-intensive and are reliant for success upon the
completeness of a {\it model of grammaticality}. But in practice, the model
will be incomplete. Given that in this thesis we deal with undergeneration by
learning, we hypothesise that the combined use of data-driven and model-based
learning would allow data-driven learning to compensate for model-based
learning's incompleteness, whilst model-based learning would compensate for
data-driven learning's unsoundness. We describe a system that we have used to
test the hypothesis empirically. The system combines data-driven and

Privacy in Deep Learning: A Survey,"  The ever-growing advances of deep learning in many areas including vision,
recommendation systems, natural language processing, etc., have led to the
adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in production systems. The availability
of large datasets and high computational power are the main contributors to
these advances. The datasets are usually crowdsourced and may contain sensitive
information. This poses serious privacy concerns as this data can be misused or
leaked through various vulnerabilities. Even if the cloud provider and the
communication link is trusted, there are still threats of inference attacks
where an attacker could speculate properties of the data used for training, or
find the underlying model architecture and parameters. In this survey, we
review the privacy concerns brought by deep learning, and the mitigating
techniques introduced to tackle these issues. We also show that there is a gap
in the literature regarding test-time inference privacy, and propose possible
future research directions.

"Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks
  using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model","  Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has
the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational
systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential
to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this
matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors
exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally,
statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating
domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for
map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive
and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning
techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road
networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain
knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale
datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning
model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as
a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder
architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a
representation that automatically captures hidden contextual structures and
spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates
data points with the road network features and thus transforms these
representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and
evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an
accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed
in natural language processing presented a promising performance for
translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.

One-shot and few-shot learning of word embeddings,"  Standard deep learning systems require thousands or millions of examples to
learn a concept, and cannot integrate new concepts easily. By contrast, humans
have an incredible ability to do one-shot or few-shot learning. For instance,
from just hearing a word used in a sentence, humans can infer a great deal
about it, by leveraging what the syntax and semantics of the surrounding words
tells us. Here, we draw inspiration from this to highlight a simple technique
by which deep recurrent networks can similarly exploit their prior knowledge to
learn a useful representation for a new word from little data. This could make
natural language processing systems much more flexible, by allowing them to
learn continually from the new words they encounter.

of supported languages and to generate models that could be integrated into
other platforms. This integration of ubiquitous Deep Learning Natural Language

"Incorporating Dictionaries into Deep Neural Networks for the Chinese
  Clinical Named Entity Recognition","  Clinical Named Entity Recognition (CNER) aims to identify and classify
clinical terms such as diseases, symptoms, treatments, exams, and body parts in
electronic health records, which is a fundamental and crucial task for clinical
and translational research. In recent years, deep neural networks have achieved
significant success in named entity recognition and many other Natural Language

can automatically learn features from large scale labeled datasets. However,
these data-driven methods typically lack the capability of processing rare or
unseen entities. Previous statistical methods and feature engineering practice

representations has been actively studied in systems neuroscience. However,
previous studies examined word-level representation, and little is known about
whether we could recover structured sentences from brain activity. This study
attempts to generate natural language descriptions of semantic contents from
human brain activity evoked by visual stimuli. To effectively use a small
amount of available brain activity data, our proposed method employs a
pre-trained image-captioning network model using a deep learning framework. To
apply brain activity to the image-captioning network, we train regression
models that learn the relationship between brain activity and deep-layer image
features. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can decode brain
activity and generate descriptions using natural language sentences. We also
conducted several experiments with data from different subsets of brain regions

Transferable Models for Bioacoustics with Human Language Supervision,"  Passive acoustic monitoring offers a scalable, non-invasive method for
tracking global biodiversity and anthropogenic impacts on species. Although
deep learning has become a vital tool for processing this data, current models
are inflexible, typically cover only a handful of species, and are limited by
data scarcity. In this work, we propose BioLingual, a new model for
bioacoustics based on contrastive language-audio pretraining. We first
aggregate bioacoustic archives into a language-audio dataset, called
AnimalSpeak, with over a million audio-caption pairs holding information on
species, vocalization context, and animal behavior. After training on this
dataset to connect language and audio representations, our model can identify
over a thousand species' calls across taxa, complete bioacoustic tasks
zero-shot, and retrieve animal vocalization recordings from natural text
queries. When fine-tuned, BioLingual sets a new state-of-the-art on nine tasks
in the Benchmark of Animal Sounds. Given its broad taxa coverage and ability to
be flexibly queried in human language, we believe this model opens new
paradigms in ecological monitoring and research, including free-text search on
the world's acoustic monitoring archives. We open-source our models, dataset,
and code.

"Prior Knowledge Driven Label Embedding for Slot Filling in Natural
  Language Understanding","  Traditional slot filling in natural language understanding (NLU) predicts a
one-hot vector for each word. This form of label representation lacks semantic
correlation modelling, which leads to severe data sparsity problem, especially
when adapting an NLU model to a new domain. To address this issue, a novel
label embedding based slot filling framework is proposed in this paper. Here,
distributed label embedding is constructed for each slot using prior knowledge.
Three encoding methods are investigated to incorporate different kinds of prior
knowledge about slots: atomic concepts, slot descriptions, and slot exemplars.
The proposed label embeddings tend to share text patterns and reuses data with
different slot labels. This makes it useful for adaptive NLU with limited data.
Also, since label embedding is independent of NLU model, it is compatible with
almost all deep learning based slot filling models. The proposed approaches are
evaluated on three datasets. Experiments on single domain and domain adaptation
tasks show that label embedding achieves significant performance improvement
over traditional one-hot label representation as well as advanced zero-shot
approaches.

learning (PAL) distinguishes itself by closely monitoring the progress of
individual students and tailoring the learning path to their unique knowledge

knowledge tracing, which models students' evolving knowledge to predict their
future performance. Based on these predictions, personalized recommendations
for resources and learning paths can be made to meet individual needs. Recent

"DeepEmotex: Classifying Emotion in Text Messages using Deep Transfer
  Learning","  Transfer learning has been widely used in natural language processing through
deep pretrained language models, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations

language models get overfitted when applied to small datasets and are prone to
forgetting when fine-tuned with a classifier. To remedy this problem of
forgetting in transferring deep pretrained language models from one domain to
another domain, existing efforts explore fine-tuning methods to forget less. We
propose DeepEmotex an effective sequential transfer learning method to detect
emotion in text. To avoid forgetting problem, the fine-tuning step is
instrumented by a large amount of emotion-labeled data collected from Twitter.
We conduct an experimental study using both curated Twitter data sets and
benchmark data sets. DeepEmotex models achieve over 91% accuracy for
multi-class emotion classification on test dataset. We evaluate the performance
of the fine-tuned DeepEmotex models in classifying emotion in EmoInt and
Stimulus benchmark datasets. The models correctly classify emotion in 73% of
the instances in the benchmark datasets. The proposed DeepEmotex-BERT model
outperforms Bi-LSTM result on the benchmark datasets by 23%. We also study the
effect of the size of the fine-tuning dataset on the accuracy of our models.
Our evaluation results show that fine-tuning with a large set of

across the globe, coupled with extended and instantaneous access to information
through online media, makes it difficult and time-consuming to monitor news
developments and opinion formation in real time. There is an increasing need
for tools that can pre-process, analyse and classify raw text to extract
interpretable content; specifically, identifying topics and content-driven
groupings of articles. We present here such a methodology that brings together
powerful vector embeddings from Natural Language Processing with tools from
Graph Theory that exploit diffusive dynamics on graphs to reveal natural
partitions across scales. Our framework uses a recent deep neural network text

applies a multi-scale community detection method (Markov Stability) to
partition a similarity graph of document vectors. The method allows us to
obtain clusters of documents with similar content, at different levels of
resolution, in an unsupervised manner. We showcase our approach with the
analysis of a corpus of 9,000 news articles published by Vox Media over one
year. Our results show consistent groupings of documents according to content
without a priori assumptions about the number or type of clusters to be found.
The multilevel clustering reveals a quasi-hierarchy of topics and subtopics

Detecting Bias in Transfer Learning Approaches for Text Classification,"  Classification is an essential and fundamental task in machine learning,

Transfer learning could be an option to transfer the knowledge from a source
domain to a target domain. A challenge is that these two domains can be
different, either on the feature distribution, or the class distribution for
the nature of the samples. In this work, we evaluate some existing transfer
learning approaches on detecting the bias of imbalanced classes including

pre-trained (Transformer) shows no such ability beyond naive repetition.
Evaluating generated music is a challenging task, more so is evaluating drum
grooves with little precedence in literature. Hence, we propose a tailored
structural evaluation method and analyze drum grooves produced by GPT3 compared
to those played by human professionals, exposing the strengths and weaknesses
of such generation by language-to-music transfer. Our findings suggest that

Continual learning on 3D point clouds with random compressed rehearsal,"  Contemporary deep neural networks offer state-of-the-art results when applied
to visual reasoning, e.g., in the context of 3D point cloud data. Point clouds
are important datatype for precise modeling of three-dimensional environments,
but effective processing of this type of data proves to be challenging. In the
world of large, heavily-parameterized network architectures and
continuously-streamed data, there is an increasing need for machine learning
models that can be trained on additional data. Unfortunately, currently
available models cannot fully leverage training on additional data without
losing their past knowledge. Combating this phenomenon, called catastrophic

insights on the diffusion and impact of DL in science. Through a Natural
Language Processing (NLP) approach on the arXiv.org publication corpus, we
delineate the emerging DL technology and identify a list of relevant search
terms. These search terms allow us to retrieve DL-related publications from Web

diffusion process in the scientific system. We find i) an exponential growth in
the adoption of DL as a research tool across all sciences and all over the
world, ii) regional differentiation in DL application domains, and iii) a
transition from interdisciplinary DL applications to disciplinary research
within application domains. In a second step, we investigate how the adoption
of DL methods affects scientific development. Therefore, we empirically assess
how DL adoption relates to re-combinatorial novelty and scientific impact in
the health sciences. We find that DL adoption is negatively correlated with
re-combinatorial novelty, but positively correlated with expectation as well as
variance of citation performance. Our findings suggest that DL does not (yet?)
work as an autopilot to navigate complex knowledge landscapes and overthrow
their structure. However, the 'DL principle' qualifies for its versatility as

"Speech representation learning: Learning bidirectional encoders with

space, aiming to improve downstream sequence prediction tasks by using the
learned representations. Supervised learning has been the most dominant
approach for training deep neural networks for learning good sequential
representations. However, one limiting factor to scale supervised learning is
the lack of enough annotated data. Motivated by this challenge, it is natural
to explore representation learning methods that can utilize large amounts of
unlabeled and weakly labeled data, as well as an additional data modality. I
describe my broad study of representation learning for speech data. Unlike most
other works that focus on a single learning setting, this thesis studies
multiple settings: supervised learning with auxiliary losses, unsupervised
learning, semi-supervised learning, and multi-view learning. Besides different
learning problems, I also explore multiple approaches for representation
learning. Though I focus on speech data, the methods described in this thesis
can also be applied to other domains. Overall, the field of representation
learning is developing rapidly. State-of-the-art results on speech related
tasks are typically based on Transformers pre-trained with large-scale
self-supervised learning, which aims to learn generic representations that can
benefit multiple downstream tasks. Since 2020, large-scale pre-training has
been the de facto choice to achieve good performance. This delayed thesis does
not attempt to summarize and compare with the latest results on speech
representation learning; instead, it presents a unique study on speech
representation learning before the Transformer era, that covers multiple
learning settings. Some of the findings in this thesis can still be useful
today.

Topics to Avoid: Demoting Latent Confounds in Text Classification,"  Despite impressive performance on many text classification tasks, deep neural
networks tend to learn frequent superficial patterns that are specific to the
training data and do not always generalize well. In this work, we observe this
limitation with respect to the task of native language identification. We find
that standard text classifiers which perform well on the test set end up
learning topical features which are confounds of the prediction task (e.g., if
the input text mentions Sweden, the classifier predicts that the author's
native language is Swedish). We propose a method that represents the latent
topical confounds and a model which ""unlearns"" confounding features by
predicting both the label of the input text and the confound; but we train the
two predictors adversarially in an alternating fashion to learn a text
representation that predicts the correct label but is less prone to using
information about the confound. We show that this model generalizes better and
learns features that are indicative of the writing style rather than the
content.

misleading claims. Ultimately, different classification algorithms are
implemented to classify service requests so that valid service requests can be
directed to the relevant service department. The proposed model- Bidirectional
Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) along with Convolution Neural Network (CNN)-
shows more than 18\% accuracy improvement in validating service requests
compared to technicians' capabilities. In addition, using domain-based NLP
techniques at preprocessing and feature extraction stages along with CNN-BiLSTM
based request validation enhanced the accuracy ($>25\%$), sensitivity
($>39\%$), specificity ($>11\%$), and precision ($>11\%$) of Gradient Tree

"Unnatural Language Processing: Bridging the Gap Between Synthetic and
  Natural Language Data","  Large, human-annotated datasets are central to the development of natural
language processing models. Collecting these datasets can be the most
challenging part of the development process. We address this problem by
introducing a general purpose technique for ``simulation-to-real'' transfer in
language understanding problems with a delimited set of target behaviors,
making it possible to develop models that can interpret natural utterances
without natural training data. We begin with a synthetic data generation
procedure, and train a model that can accurately interpret utterances produced
by the data generator. To generalize to natural utterances, we automatically
find projections of natural language utterances onto the support of the
synthetic language, using learned sentence embeddings to define a distance
metric. With only synthetic training data, our approach matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art models trained on natural language data in several domains.
These results suggest that simulation-to-real transfer is a practical framework
for developing NLP applications, and that improved models for transfer might
provide wide-ranging improvements in downstream tasks.

Deep Clustering with Measure Propagation,"  Deep models have improved state-of-the-art for both supervised and
unsupervised learning. For example, deep embedded clustering (DEC) has greatly
improved the unsupervised clustering performance, by using stacked autoencoders
for representation learning. However, one weakness of deep modeling is that the
local neighborhood structure in the original space is not necessarily preserved
in the latent space. To preserve local geometry, various methods have been
proposed in the supervised and semi-supervised learning literature (e.g.,
spectral clustering and label propagation) using graph Laplacian
regularization. In this paper, we combine the strength of deep representation
learning with measure propagation (MP), a KL-divergence based graph
regularization method originally used in the semi-supervised scenario. The main
assumption of MP is that if two data points are close in the original space,
they are likely to belong to the same class, measured by KL-divergence of class
membership distribution. By taking the same assumption in the unsupervised
learning scenario, we propose our Deep Embedded Clustering Aided by Measure
Propagation (DECAMP) model. We evaluate DECAMP on short text clustering tasks.
On three public datasets, DECAMP performs competitively with other
state-of-the-art baselines, including baselines using additional data to
generate word embeddings used in the clustering process. As an example, on the
Stackoverflow dataset, DECAMP achieved a clustering accuracy of 79%, which is
about 5% higher than all existing baselines. These empirical results suggest
that DECAMP is a very effective method for unsupervised learning.

"Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning for Medical Adverse Event
  Detection from Free-Text Medical Narratives: A Case Study of Detecting Total

medical narratives is challenging. Natural language processing (NLP) with deep
learning has already shown great potential for analyzing free-text data, but
its application for medical AE detection has been limited. In this study we
proposed deep learning based NLP (DL-NLP) models for efficient and accurate hip
dislocation AE detection following total hip replacement from standard
(radiology notes) and non-standard (follow-up telephone notes) free-text
medical narratives. We benchmarked these proposed models with a wide variety of
traditional machine learning based NLP (ML-NLP) models, and also assessed the
accuracy of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Current
Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes in capturing these hip dislocation AEs in a
multi-center orthopaedic registry. All DL-NLP models out-performed all of the
ML-NLP models, with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model achieving the
best overall performance (Kappa = 0.97 for radiology notes, and Kappa = 1.00
for follow-up telephone notes). On the other hand, the ICD/CPT codes of the
patients who sustained a hip dislocation AE were only 75.24% accurate, showing
the potential of the proposed model to be used in largescale orthopaedic

"APALU: A Trainable, Adaptive Activation Function for Deep Learning
  Networks","  Activation function is a pivotal component of deep learning, facilitating the
extraction of intricate data patterns. While classical activation functions
like ReLU and its variants are extensively utilized, their static nature and
simplicity, despite being advantageous, often limit their effectiveness in
specialized tasks. The trainable activation functions also struggle sometimes
to adapt to the unique characteristics of the data. Addressing these
limitations, we introduce a novel trainable activation function, adaptive
piecewise approximated activation linear unit (APALU), to enhance the learning
performance of deep learning across a broad range of tasks. It presents a
unique set of features that enable it to maintain stability and efficiency in
the learning process while adapting to complex data representations.
Experiments reveal significant improvements over widely used activation
functions for different tasks. In image classification, APALU increases
MobileNet and GoogleNet accuracy by 0.37% and 0.04%, respectively, on the
CIFAR10 dataset. In anomaly detection, it improves the average area under the
curve of One-CLASS Deep SVDD by 0.8% on the MNIST dataset, 1.81% and 1.11%
improvements with DifferNet, and knowledge distillation, respectively, on the
MVTech dataset. Notably, APALU achieves 100% accuracy on a sign language
recognition task with a limited dataset. For regression tasks, APALU enhances
the performance of deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks on
different datasets. These improvements highlight the robustness and
adaptability of APALU across diverse deep-learning applications.

  Learning Models Using High Performance Computing and Quantum Annealing","  Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) of Deep Learning-based models tends to be a
compute resource intensive process as it usually requires to train the target

integrating model performance prediction with early stopping methods holds
great potential to speed up the HPO process of deep learning models. Moreover,
we propose a novel algorithm called Swift-Hyperband that can use either
classical or quantum support vector regression for performance prediction and
benefit from distributed High Performance Computing environments. This
algorithm is tested not only for the Machine-Learned Particle Flow model used
in High Energy Physics, but also for a wider range of target models from

Swift-Hyperband is shown to find comparable (or better) hyperparameters as well

also ""knowledge poor"". Healthcare systems collect huge amounts of data from
various sources: lab reports, medical letters, logs of medical tools or

great knowledge and information that can improve the medical services, and
overall the healthcare domain, such as disease prediction by analyzing the
patient's symptoms or disease prevention, by facilitating the discovery of
behavioral factors for diseases. Unfortunately, only a relatively small volume
of the textual eHealth data is processed and interpreted, an important factor
being the difficulty in efficiently performing Big Data operations. In the
medical field, detecting domain-specific multi-word terms is a crucial task as
they can define an entire concept with a few words. A term can be defined as a
linguistic structure or a concept, and it is composed of one or more words with
a specific meaning to a domain. All the terms of a domain create its
terminology. This chapter offers a critical study of the current, most
performant solutions for analyzing unstructured (image and textual) eHealth

Knowledge Graphs Querying,"  Knowledge graphs (KGs) such as DBpedia, Freebase, YAGO, Wikidata, and NELL
were constructed to store large-scale, real-world facts as (subject, predicate,
object) triples -- that can also be modeled as a graph, where a node (a subject
or an object) represents an entity with attributes, and a directed edge (a
predicate) is a relationship between two entities. Querying KGs is critical in
web search, question answering (QA), semantic search, personal assistants, fact
checking, and recommendation. While significant progress has been made on KG
construction and curation, thanks to deep learning recently we have seen a
surge of research on KG querying and QA. The objectives of our survey are
two-fold. First, research on KG querying has been conducted by several
communities, such as databases, data mining, semantic web, machine learning,
information retrieval, and natural language processing (NLP), with different
focus and terminologies; and also in diverse topics ranging from graph
databases, query languages, join algorithms, graph patterns matching, to more
sophisticated KG embedding and natural language questions (NLQs). We aim at
uniting different interdisciplinary topics and concepts that have been
developed for KG querying. Second, many recent advances on KG and query
embedding, multimodal KG, and KG-QA come from deep learning, IR, NLP, and
computer vision domains. We identify important challenges of KG querying that
received less attention by graph databases, and by the DB community in general,
e.g., incomplete KG, semantic matching, multimodal data, and NLQs. We conclude
by discussing interesting opportunities for the data management community, for
instance, KG as a unified data model and vector-based query processing.

Tree Edit Distance Learning via Adaptive Symbol Embeddings,"  Metric learning has the aim to improve classification accuracy by learning a
distance measure which brings data points from the same class closer together
and pushes data points from different classes further apart. Recent research
has demonstrated that metric learning approaches can also be applied to trees,
such as molecular structures, abstract syntax trees of computer programs, or
syntax trees of natural language, by learning the cost function of an edit
distance, i.e. the costs of replacing, deleting, or inserting nodes in a tree.
However, learning such costs directly may yield an edit distance which violates
metric axioms, is challenging to interpret, and may not generalize well. In
this contribution, we propose a novel metric learning approach for trees which
we call embedding edit distance learning (BEDL) and which learns an edit
distance indirectly by embedding the tree nodes as vectors, such that the
Euclidean distance between those vectors supports class discrimination. We
learn such embeddings by reducing the distance to prototypical trees from the
same class and increasing the distance to prototypical trees from different
classes. In our experiments, we show that BEDL improves upon the
state-of-the-art in metric learning for trees on six benchmark data sets,
ranging from computer science over biomedical data to a natural-language
processing data set containing over 300,000 nodes.

Building Advanced Dialogue Managers for Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems,"  Goal-Oriented (GO) Dialogue Systems, colloquially known as goal oriented
chatbots, help users achieve a predefined goal (e.g. book a movie ticket)
within a closed domain. A first step is to understand the user's goal by using
natural language understanding techniques. Once the goal is known, the bot must
manage a dialogue to achieve that goal, which is conducted with respect to a
learnt policy. The success of the dialogue system depends on the quality of the
policy, which is in turn reliant on the availability of high-quality training
data for the policy learning method, for instance Deep Reinforcement Learning.
  Due to the domain specificity, the amount of available data is typically too
low to allow the training of good dialogue policies. In this master thesis we
introduce a transfer learning method to mitigate the effects of the low
in-domain data availability. Our transfer learning based approach improves the
bot's success rate by $20\%$ in relative terms for distant domains and we more
than double it for close domains, compared to the model without transfer
learning. Moreover, the transfer learning chatbots learn the policy up to 5 to
10 times faster. Finally, as the transfer learning approach is complementary to
additional processing such as warm-starting, we show that their joint
application gives the best outcomes.

"Knowledge Distillation in Automated Annotation: Supervised Text
  Classification with LLM-Generated Training Labels","  Computational social science (CSS) practitioners often rely on human-labeled
data to fine-tune supervised text classifiers. We assess the potential for
researchers to augment or replace human-generated training data with surrogate
training labels from generative large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
recommended workflow and test this LLM application by replicating 14
classification tasks and measuring performance. We employ a novel corpus of
English-language text classification data sets from recent CSS articles in
high-impact journals. Because these data sets are stored in password-protected
archives, our analyses are less prone to issues of contamination. For each
task, we compare supervised classifiers fine-tuned using GPT-4 labels against
classifiers fine-tuned with human annotations and against labels from GPT-4 and
Mistral-7B with few-shot in-context learning. Our findings indicate that
supervised classification models fine-tuned on LLM-generated labels perform
comparably to models fine-tuned with labels from human annotators. Fine-tuning
models using LLM-generated labels can be a fast, efficient and cost-effective
method of building supervised text classifiers.

"Resource Allocation and Workload Scheduling for Large-Scale Distributed
  Deep Learning: A Survey","  With rapidly increasing distributed deep learning workloads in large-scale
data centers, efficient distributed deep learning framework strategies for
resource allocation and workload scheduling have become the key to
high-performance deep learning. The large-scale environment with large volumes
of datasets, models, and computational and communication resources raises
various unique challenges for resource allocation and workload scheduling in
distributed deep learning, such as scheduling complexity, resource and workload
heterogeneity, and fault tolerance. To uncover these challenges and
corresponding solutions, this survey reviews the literature, mainly from 2019
to 2024, on efficient resource allocation and workload scheduling strategies
for large-scale distributed DL. We explore these strategies by focusing on
various resource types, scheduling granularity levels, and performance goals
during distributed training and inference processes. We highlight critical
challenges for each topic and discuss key insights of existing technologies. To
illustrate practical large-scale resource allocation and workload scheduling in
real distributed deep learning scenarios, we use a case study of training large

"Med7: a transferable clinical natural language processing model for
  electronic health records","  The field of clinical natural language processing has been advanced
significantly since the introduction of deep learning models. The
self-supervised representation learning and the transfer learning paradigm
became the methods of choice in many natural language processing application,
in particular in the settings with the dearth of high quality manually
annotated data. Electronic health record systems are ubiquitous and the
majority of patients' data are now being collected electronically and in
particular in the form of free text. Identification of medical concepts and
information extraction is a challenging task, yet important ingredient for
parsing unstructured data into structured and tabulated format for downstream
analytical tasks. In this work we introduced a named-entity recognition model
for clinical natural language processing. The model is trained to recognise
seven categories: drug names, route, frequency, dosage, strength, form,
duration. The model was first self-supervisedly pre-trained by predicting the
next word, using a collection of 2 million free-text patients' records from
MIMIC-III corpora and then fine-tuned on the named-entity recognition task. The
model achieved a lenient (strict) micro-averaged F1 score of 0.957 (0.893)
across all seven categories. Additionally, we evaluated the transferability of
the developed model using the data from the Intensive Care Unit in the US to
secondary care mental health records (CRIS) in the UK. A direct application of
the trained NER model to CRIS data resulted in reduced performance of F1=0.762,
however after fine-tuning on a small sample from CRIS, the model achieved a
reasonable performance of F1=0.944. This demonstrated that despite a close
similarity between the data sets and the NER tasks, it is essential to
fine-tune on the target domain data in order to achieve more accurate results.

"Robust Task-Oriented Dialogue Generation with Contrastive Pre-training
  and Adversarial Filtering","  Data artifacts incentivize machine learning models to learn non-transferable
generalizations by taking advantage of shortcuts in the data, and there is
growing evidence that data artifacts play a role for the strong results that
deep learning models achieve in recent natural language processing benchmarks.
In this paper, we focus on task-oriented dialogue and investigate whether
popular datasets such as MultiWOZ contain such data artifacts. We found that by
only keeping frequent phrases in the training examples, state-of-the-art models
perform similarly compared to the variant trained with full data, suggesting
they exploit these spurious correlations to solve the task. Motivated by this,
we propose a contrastive learning based framework to encourage the model to
ignore these cues and focus on learning generalisable patterns. We also
experiment with adversarial filtering to remove ""easy"" training instances so
that the model would focus on learning from the ""harder"" instances. We conduct
a number of generalization experiments -- e.g., cross-domain/dataset and
adversarial tests -- to assess the robustness of our approach and found that it
works exceptionally well.

"Using Error Decay Prediction to Overcome Practical Issues of Deep Active
  Learning for Named Entity Recognition","  Existing deep active learning algorithms achieve impressive sampling
efficiency on natural language processing tasks. However, they exhibit several
weaknesses in practice, including (a) inability to use uncertainty sampling
with black-box models, (b) lack of robustness to labeling noise, and (c) lack
of transparency. In response, we propose a transparent batch active sampling
framework by estimating the error decay curves of multiple feature-defined
subsets of the data. Experiments on four named entity recognition (NER) tasks
demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform
diversification-based methods for black-box NER taggers, and can make the
sampling process more robust to labeling noise when combined with
uncertainty-based methods. Furthermore, the analysis of experimental results
sheds light on the weaknesses of different active sampling strategies, and when

Deep Active Learning with Noise Stability,"  Uncertainty estimation for unlabeled data is crucial to active learning. With
a deep neural network employed as the backbone model, the data selection
process is highly challenging due to the potential over-confidence of the model
inference. Existing methods resort to special learning fashions (e.g.
adversarial) or auxiliary models to address this challenge. This tends to
result in complex and inefficient pipelines, which would render the methods
impractical. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that leverages noise
stability to estimate data uncertainty. The key idea is to measure the output
derivation from the original observation when the model parameters are randomly
perturbed by noise. We provide theoretical analyses by leveraging the small
Gaussian noise theory and demonstrate that our method favors a subset with
large and diverse gradients. Our method is generally applicable in various
tasks, including computer vision, natural language processing, and structural
data analysis. It achieves competitive performance compared against
state-of-the-art active learning baselines.

powerful fit of physics-informed augmentation for providing significant boost
to predictive accuracy. Successfully verified by the prediction of rejection

relative error dropping from 16.34% to 6.71% and the coefficient of

Self-Knowledge Distillation in Natural Language Processing,"  Since deep learning became a key player in natural language processing (NLP),
many deep learning models have been showing remarkable performances in a
variety of NLP tasks, and in some cases, they are even outperforming humans.
Such high performance can be explained by efficient knowledge representation of
deep learning models. While many methods have been proposed to learn more
efficient representation, knowledge distillation from pretrained deep networks
suggest that we can use more information from the soft target probability to
train other neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new knowledge
distillation method self-knowledge distillation, based on the soft target
probabilities of the training model itself, where multimode information is
distilled from the word embedding space right below the softmax layer. Due to
the time complexity, our method approximates the soft target probabilities. In
experiments, we applied the proposed method to two different and fundamental
NLP tasks: language model and neural machine translation. The experiment
results show that our proposed method improves performance on the tasks.

"Positional Attention-based Frame Identification with BERT: A Deep
  Learning Approach to Target Disambiguation and Semantic Frame Selection","  Semantic parsing is the task of transforming sentences from natural language
into formal representations of predicate-argument structures. Under this
research area, frame-semantic parsing has attracted much interest. This parsing
approach leverages the lexical information defined in FrameNet to associate
marked predicates or targets with semantic frames, thereby assigning semantic
roles to sentence components based on pre-specified frame elements in FrameNet.
In this paper, a deep neural network architecture known as Positional
Attention-based Frame Identification with BERT (PAFIBERT) is presented as a
solution to the frame identification subtask in frame-semantic parsing.
Although the importance of this subtask is well-established, prior research has
yet to find a robust solution that works satisfactorily for both in-domain and
out-of-domain data. This study thus set out to improve frame identification in
light of recent advancements of language modeling and transfer learning in
natural language processing. The proposed method is partially empowered by
BERT, a pre-trained language model that excels at capturing contextual
information in texts. By combining the language representation power of BERT
with a position-based attention mechanism, PAFIBERT is able to attend to
target-specific contexts in sentences for disambiguating targets and
associating them with the most suitable semantic frames. Under various
experimental settings, PAFIBERT outperformed existing solutions by a
significant margin, achieving new state-of-the-art results for both in-domain
and out-of-domain benchmark test sets.

A Survey on Backdoor Attack and Defense in Natural Language Processing,"  Deep learning is becoming increasingly popular in real-life applications,
especially in natural language processing (NLP). Users often choose training
outsourcing or adopt third-party data and models due to data and computation

process to inject some triggers into the model, which is called backdoor
attack. Backdoor attack is quite stealthy and difficult to be detected because
it has little inferior influence on the model's performance for the clean
samples. To get a precise grasp and understanding of this problem, in this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of backdoor attacks and defenses in

Fidelity-Weighted Learning,"  Training deep neural networks requires many training samples, but in practice
training labels are expensive to obtain and may be of varying quality, as some
may be from trusted expert labelers while others might be from heuristics or
other sources of weak supervision such as crowd-sourcing. This creates a
fundamental quality versus-quantity trade-off in the learning process. Do we
learn from the small amount of high-quality data or the potentially large
amount of weakly-labeled data? We argue that if the learner could somehow know
and take the label-quality into account when learning the data representation,
we could get the best of both worlds. To this end, we propose
""fidelity-weighted learning"" (FWL), a semi-supervised student-teacher approach
for training deep neural networks using weakly-labeled data. FWL modulates the
parameter updates to a student network (trained on the task we care about) on a
per-sample basis according to the posterior confidence of its label-quality
estimated by a teacher (who has access to the high-quality labels). Both
student and teacher are learned from the data. We evaluate FWL on two tasks in
information retrieval and natural language processing where we outperform
state-of-the-art alternative semi-supervised methods, indicating that our
approach makes better use of strong and weak labels, and leads to better

"Tree Edit Distance Learning via Adaptive Symbol Embeddings:
  Supplementary Materials and Results","  Metric learning has the aim to improve classification accuracy by learning a
distance measure which brings data points from the same class closer together
and pushes data points from different classes further apart. Recent research
has demonstrated that metric learning approaches can also be applied to trees,
such as molecular structures, abstract syntax trees of computer programs, or
syntax trees of natural language, by learning the cost function of an edit
distance, i.e. the costs of replacing, deleting, or inserting nodes in a tree.
However, learning such costs directly may yield an edit distance which violates
metric axioms, is challenging to interpret, and may not generalize well. In
this contribution, we propose a novel metric learning approach for trees which
learns an edit distance indirectly by embedding the tree nodes as vectors, such
that the Euclidean distance between those vectors supports class
discrimination. We learn such embeddings by reducing the distance to
prototypical trees from the same class and increasing the distance to
prototypical trees from different classes. In our experiments, we show that our

ZeroBERTo: Leveraging Zero-Shot Text Classification by Topic Modeling,"  Traditional text classification approaches often require a good amount of
labeled data, which is difficult to obtain, especially in restricted domains or
less widespread languages. This lack of labeled data has led to the rise of
low-resource methods, that assume low data availability in natural language
processing. Among them, zero-shot learning stands out, which consists of
learning a classifier without any previously labeled data. The best results
reported with this approach use language models such as Transformers, but fall
into two problems: high execution time and inability to handle long texts as
input. This paper proposes a new model, ZeroBERTo, which leverages an
unsupervised clustering step to obtain a compressed data representation before
the classification task. We show that ZeroBERTo has better performance for long
inputs and shorter execution time, outperforming XLM-R by about 12% in the F1
score in the FolhaUOL dataset. Keywords: Low-Resource NLP, Unlabeled data,
Zero-Shot Learning, Topic Modeling, Transformers.

Emotion Based Hate Speech Detection using Multimodal Learning,"  In recent years, monitoring hate speech and offensive language on social
media platforms has become paramount due to its widespread usage among all age
groups, races, and ethnicities. Consequently, there have been substantial
research efforts towards automated detection of such content using Natural
Language Processing (NLP). While successfully filtering textual data, no
research has focused on detecting hateful content in multimedia data. With
increased ease of data storage and the exponential growth of social media
platforms, multimedia content proliferates the internet as much as text data.
Nevertheless, it escapes the automatic filtering systems. Hate speech and
offensiveness can be detected in multimedia primarily via three modalities,
i.e., visual, acoustic, and verbal. Our preliminary study concluded that the
most essential features in classifying hate speech would be the speaker's
emotional state and its influence on the spoken words, therefore limiting our
current research to these modalities. This paper proposes the first multimodal
deep learning framework to combine the auditory features representing emotion
and the semantic features to detect hateful content. Our results demonstrate
that incorporating emotional attributes leads to significant improvement over
text-based models in detecting hateful multimedia content. This paper also
presents a new Hate Speech Detection Video Dataset (HSDVD) collected for the
purpose of multimodal learning as no such dataset exists today.

A Survey on Green Deep Learning,"  In recent years, larger and deeper models are springing up and continuously
pushing state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various fields like natural
language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, despite promising
results, it needs to be noted that the computations required by SOTA models
have been increased at an exponential rate. Massive computations not only have
a surprisingly large carbon footprint but also have negative effects on
research inclusiveness and deployment on real-world applications.
  Green deep learning is an increasingly hot research field that appeals to
researchers to pay attention to energy usage and carbon emission during model
training and inference. The target is to yield novel results with lightweight
and efficient technologies. Many technologies can be used to achieve this goal,
like model compression and knowledge distillation. This paper focuses on
presenting a systematic review of the development of Green deep learning
technologies. We classify these approaches into four categories: (1) compact
networks, (2) energy-efficient training strategies, (3) energy-efficient
inference approaches, and (4) efficient data usage. For each category, we
discuss the progress that has been achieved and the unresolved challenges.

"Textual Data Mining for Financial Fraud Detection: A Deep Learning

financial-fraud texts. First, I searched for regulatory announcements and
enforcement bulletins from HKEX news to define fraudulent companies and to

vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for the text classification task. By utilizing this
diverse set of models, I aim to perform a comprehensive comparison of their
accuracy in detecting financial fraud. My results bring significant

Using Sequences of Life-events to Predict Human Lives,"  Over the past decade, machine learning has revolutionized computers' ability
to analyze text through flexible computational models. Due to their structural
similarity to written language, transformer-based architectures have also shown
promise as tools to make sense of a range of multi-variate sequences from
protein-structures, music, electronic health records to weather-forecasts. We
can also represent human lives in a way that shares this structural similarity
to language. From one perspective, lives are simply sequences of events: People
are born, visit the pediatrician, start school, move to a new location, get
married, and so on. Here, we exploit this similarity to adapt innovations from
natural language processing to examine the evolution and predictability of
human lives based on detailed event sequences. We do this by drawing on
arguably the most comprehensive registry data in existence, available for an
entire nation of more than six million individuals across decades. Our data
include information about life-events related to health, education, occupation,
income, address, and working hours, recorded with day-to-day resolution. We
create embeddings of life-events in a single vector space showing that this
embedding space is robust and highly structured. Our models allow us to predict
diverse outcomes ranging from early mortality to personality nuances,
outperforming state-of-the-art models by a wide margin. Using methods for
interpreting deep learning models, we probe the algorithm to understand the
factors that enable our predictions. Our framework allows researchers to
identify new potential mechanisms that impact life outcomes and associated
possibilities for personalized interventions.

PassTSL: Modeling Human-Created Passwords through Two-Stage Learning,"  Textual passwords are still the most widely used user authentication
mechanism. Due to the close connections between textual passwords and natural
languages, advanced technologies in natural language processing (NLP) and
machine learning (ML) could be used to model passwords for different purposes
such as studying human password-creation behaviors and developing more advanced
password cracking methods for informing better defence mechanisms. In this
paper, we propose PassTSL (modeling human-created Passwords through Two-Stage
Learning), inspired by the popular pretraining-finetuning framework in NLP and
deep learning (DL). We report how different pretraining settings affected
PassTSL and proved its effectiveness by applying it to six large leaked
password databases. Experimental results showed that it outperforms five
state-of-the-art (SOTA) password cracking methods on password guessing by a
significant margin ranging from 4.11% to 64.69% at the maximum point. Based on
PassTSL, we also implemented a password strength meter (PSM), and our
experiments showed that it was able to estimate password strength more
accurately, causing fewer unsafe errors (overestimating the password strength)
than two other SOTA PSMs when they produce the same rate of safe errors
(underestimating the password strength): a neural-network based method and
zxcvbn. Furthermore, we explored multiple finetuning settings, and our
evaluations showed that, even a small amount of additional training data, e.g.,
only 0.1% of the pretrained data, can lead to over 3% improvement in password
guessing on average. We also proposed a heuristic approach to selecting
finetuning passwords based on JS (Jensen-Shannon) divergence and experimental
results validated its usefulness. In summary, our contributions demonstrate the
potential and feasibility of applying advanced NLP and ML methods to password
modeling and cracking.

"Tinto: Multisensor Benchmark for 3D Hyperspectral Point Cloud
  Segmentation in the Geosciences","  The increasing use of deep learning techniques has reduced interpretation
time and, ideally, reduced interpreter bias by automatically deriving
geological maps from digital outcrop models. However, accurate validation of
these automated mapping approaches is a significant challenge due to the
subjective nature of geological mapping and the difficulty in collecting
quantitative validation data. Additionally, many state-of-the-art deep learning
methods are limited to 2D image data, which is insufficient for 3D digital
outcrops, such as hyperclouds. To address these challenges, we present Tinto, a
multi-sensor benchmark digital outcrop dataset designed to facilitate the
development and validation of deep learning approaches for geological mapping,
especially for non-structured 3D data like point clouds. Tinto comprises two
complementary sets: 1) a real digital outcrop model from Corta Atalaya (Spain),
with spectral attributes and ground-truth data, and 2) a synthetic twin that
uses latent features in the original datasets to reconstruct realistic spectral
data (including sensor noise and processing artifacts) from the ground-truth.
The point cloud is dense and contains 3,242,964 labeled points. We used these
datasets to explore the abilities of different deep learning approaches for
automated geological mapping. By making Tinto publicly available, we hope to
foster the development and adaptation of new deep learning tools for 3D
applications in Earth sciences. The dataset can be accessed through this link:

"Machine and Deep Learning Methods with Manual and Automatic Labelling
  for News Classification in Bangla Language","  Research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has increasingly become
important due to applications such as text classification, text mining,
sentiment analysis, POS tagging, named entity recognition, textual entailment,
and many others. This paper introduces several machine and deep learning
methods with manual and automatic labelling for news classification in the
Bangla language. We implemented several machine (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms. The ML algorithms are Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest
Neighbour (KNN), used with Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document
Frequency (TF-IDF), and Doc2Vec embedding models. The DL algorithms are Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), used with Word2vec, Glove, and
FastText word embedding models. We develop automatic labelling methods using
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and investigate the performance of
single-label and multi-label article classification methods. To investigate
performance, we developed from scratch Potrika, the largest and the most
extensive dataset for news classification in the Bangla language, comprising
185.51 million words and 12.57 million sentences contained in 664,880 news
articles in eight distinct categories, curated from six popular online news
portals in Bangladesh for the period 2014-2020. GRU and Fasttext with 91.83%
achieve the highest accuracy for manually-labelled data. For the automatic
labelling case, KNN and Doc2Vec at 57.72% and 75% achieve the highest accuracy
for single-label and multi-label data, respectively. The methods developed in
this paper are expected to advance research in Bangla and other languages.

"Integrating Chemical Language and Molecular Graph in Multimodal Fused
  Deep Learning for Drug Property Prediction","  Accurately predicting molecular properties is a challenging but essential
task in drug discovery. Recently, many mono-modal deep learning methods have
been successfully applied to molecular property prediction. However, the
inherent limitation of mono-modal learning arises from relying solely on one
modality of molecular representation, which restricts a comprehensive
understanding of drug molecules and hampers their resilience against data
noise. To overcome the limitations, we construct multimodal deep learning
models to cover different molecular representations. We convert drug molecules
into three molecular representations, SMILES-encoded vectors, ECFP
fingerprints, and molecular graphs. To process the modal information,
Transformer-Encoder, bi-directional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), and graph
convolutional network (GCN) are utilized for feature learning respectively,
which can enhance the model capability to acquire complementary and naturally
occurring bioinformatics information. We evaluated our triple-modal model on
six molecule datasets. Different from bi-modal learning models, we adopt five
fusion methods to capture the specific features and leverage the contribution
of each modal information better. Compared with mono-modal models, our
multimodal fused deep learning (MMFDL) models outperform single models in
accuracy, reliability, and resistance capability against noise. Moreover, we
demonstrate its generalization ability in the prediction of binding constants
for protein-ligand complex molecules in the refined set of PDBbind. The
advantage of the multimodal model lies in its ability to process diverse
sources of data using proper models and suitable fusion methods, which would
enhance the noise resistance of the model while obtaining data diversity.

means to scale educational tasks to the growing number of students. Recent
progress in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning has largely
influenced the field of ASAG, of which we survey the recent research
advancements. We complement previous surveys by providing a comprehensive

particular, we focus our analysis on the transition from hand engineered

features for the task at hand automatically from large corpora of data. We

embeddings, sequential models, and attention-based methods. Deep learning
impacted ASAG differently than other fields of NLP, as we noticed that the
learned representations alone do not contribute to achieve the best results,
but they rather show to work in a complementary way with hand-engineered
features. The best performance are indeed achieved by methods that combine the
carefully hand-engineered features with the power of the semantic descriptions
provided by the latest models, like transformers architectures. We identify
challenges and provide an outlook on research direction that can be addressed
in the future

IndicSTR12: A Dataset for Indic Scene Text Recognition,"  The importance of Scene Text Recognition (STR) in today's increasingly
digital world cannot be overstated. Given the significance of STR, data
intensive deep learning approaches that auto-learn feature mappings have
primarily driven the development of STR solutions. Several benchmark datasets
and substantial work on deep learning models are available for Latin languages
to meet this need. On more complex, syntactically and semantically, Indian
languages spoken and read by 1.3 billion people, there is less work and
datasets available. This paper aims to address the Indian space's lack of a
comprehensive dataset by proposing the largest and most comprehensive real
dataset - IndicSTR12 - and benchmarking STR performance on 12 major Indian
languages. A few works have addressed the same issue, but to the best of our
knowledge, they focused on a small number of Indian languages. The size and
complexity of the proposed dataset are comparable to those of existing Latin
contemporaries, while its multilingualism will catalyse the development of
robust text detection and recognition models. It was created specifically for a
group of related languages with different scripts. The dataset contains over
27000 word-images gathered from various natural scenes, with over 1000
word-images for each language. Unlike previous datasets, the images cover a

Deep Learning Model for Finding New Superconductors,"  Exploration of new superconductors still relies on the experience and
intuition of experts and is largely a process of experimental trial and error.
In one study, only 3% of the candidate materials showed superconductivity.
Here, we report the first deep learning model for finding new superconductors.
We introduced the method named ""reading periodic table"" which represented the
periodic table in a way that allows deep learning to learn to read the periodic
table and to learn the law of elements for the purpose of discovering novel
superconductors that are outside the training data. It is recognized that it is
difficult for deep learning to predict something outside the training data.
Although we used only the chemical composition of materials as information, we
obtained an $R^{2}$ value of 0.92 for predicting $T_\text{c}$ for materials in
a database of superconductors. We also introduced the method named ""garbage-in""
to create synthetic data of non-superconductors that do not exist.
Non-superconductors are not reported, but the data must be required for deep
learning to distinguish between superconductors and non-superconductors. We
obtained three remarkable results. The deep learning can predict
superconductivity for a material with a precision of 62%, which shows the
usefulness of the model; it found the recently discovered superconductor CaBi2
and another one Hf0.5Nb0.2V2Zr0.3, neither of which is in the superconductor
database; and it found Fe-based high-temperature superconductors (discovered in
2008) from the training data before 2008. These results open the way for the
discovery of new high-temperature superconductor families. The candidate
materials list, data, and method are openly available from the link

"Synergizing Unsupervised and Supervised Learning: A Hybrid Approach for
  Accurate Natural Language Task Modeling","  While supervised learning models have shown remarkable performance in various
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their success heavily relies on the
availability of large-scale labeled datasets, which can be costly and
time-consuming to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised learning techniques can
leverage abundant unlabeled text data to learn rich representations, but they
do not directly optimize for specific NLP tasks. This paper presents a novel
hybrid approach that synergizes unsupervised and supervised learning to improve
the accuracy of NLP task modeling. While supervised models excel at specific
tasks, they rely on large labeled datasets. Unsupervised techniques can learn
rich representations from abundant unlabeled text but don't directly optimize
for tasks. Our methodology integrates an unsupervised module that learns
representations from unlabeled corpora (e.g., language models, word embeddings)
and a supervised module that leverages these representations to enhance
task-specific models. We evaluate our approach on text classification and named
entity recognition (NER), demonstrating consistent performance gains over
supervised baselines. For text classification, contextual word embeddings from
a language model pretrain a recurrent or transformer-based classifier. For NER,
word embeddings initialize a BiLSTM sequence labeler. By synergizing
techniques, our hybrid approach achieves SOTA results on benchmark datasets,
paving the way for more data-efficient and robust NLP systems.

Natural Language-Guided Programming,"  In today's software world with its cornucopia of reusable software libraries,
when a programmer is faced with a programming task that they suspect can be
completed through the use of a library, they often look for code examples using
a search engine and then manually adapt found examples to their specific
context of use. We put forward a vision based on a new breed of developer tools

adapt code autocompletion tools such that they take into account not only the
developer's already-written code but also the intent of the task the developer
is trying to achieve next, formulated in plain natural language. We call this
practice of enriching the code with natural language intent to facilitate its
completion natural language-guided programming.
  To show that this idea is feasible we design, implement and benchmark a tool
that solves this problem in the context of a specific domain (data science) and
a specific programming language (Python). Central to the tool is the use of
language models trained on a large corpus of documented code. Our initial

"A Large Language Model and Denoising Diffusion Framework for Targeted

properties of materials, with applications spanning alloy design, MEMS devices,
and tissue engineering, among many others. Computational frameworks have been
developed to capture the complex relationship between microstructure and
material behavior. However, despite these advancements, the steep learning
curve associated with domain-specific knowledge and complex algorithms
restricts the broader application of these tools. To lower this barrier, we
propose a framework that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large

enable microstructure design using intuitive natural language commands. Our
framework employs contextual data augmentation, driven by a pretrained LLM, to
generate and expand a diverse dataset of microstructure descriptors. A
retrained NER model extracts relevant microstructure descriptors from
user-provided natural language inputs, which are then used by the DDPM to
generate microstructures with targeted mechanical properties and topological
features. The NLP and DDPM components of the framework are modular, allowing
for separate training and validation, which ensures flexibility in adapting the
framework to different datasets and use cases. A surrogate model system is
employed to rank and filter generated samples based on their alignment with
target properties. Demonstrated on a database of nonlinear hyperelastic
microstructures, this framework serves as a prototype for accessible inverse
design of microstructures, starting from intuitive natural language commands.

A Morphology-aware Network for Morphological Disambiguation,"  Agglutinative languages such as Turkish, Finnish and Hungarian require
morphological disambiguation before further processing due to the complex
morphology of words. A morphological disambiguator is used to select the
correct morphological analysis of a word. Morphological disambiguation is
important because it generally is one of the first steps of natural language
processing and its performance affects subsequent analyses. In this paper, we
propose a system that uses deep learning techniques for morphological
disambiguation. Many of the state-of-the-art results in computer vision, speech
recognition and natural language processing have been obtained through deep
learning models. However, applying deep learning techniques to morphologically
rich languages is not well studied. In this work, while we focus on Turkish
morphological disambiguation we also present results for French and German in
order to show that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy with no
language-specific feature engineering or additional resource. In the

SKOPE: A connectionist/symbolic architecture of spoken Korean processing,"  Spoken language processing requires speech and natural language integration.
Moreover, spoken Korean calls for unique processing methodology due to its
linguistic characteristics. This paper presents SKOPE, a connectionist/symbolic
spoken Korean processing engine, which emphasizes that: 1) connectionist and
symbolic techniques must be selectively applied according to their relative
strength and weakness, and 2) the linguistic characteristics of Korean must be
fully considered for phoneme recognition, speech and language integration, and
morphological/syntactic processing. The design and implementation of SKOPE
demonstrates how connectionist/symbolic hybrid architectures can be constructed
for spoken agglutinative language processing. Also SKOPE presents many novel
ideas for speech and language processing. The phoneme recognition,
morphological analysis, and syntactic analysis experiments show that SKOPE is a
viable approach for the spoken Korean processing.

"Accelerating materials discovery for polymer solar cells: Data-driven
  insights enabled by natural language processing","  We present a simulation of various active learning strategies for the
discovery of polymer solar cell donor/acceptor pairs using data extracted from
the literature spanning $\sim$20 years by a natural language processing
pipeline. While data-driven methods have been well established to discover
novel materials faster than Edisonian trial-and-error approaches, their
benefits have not been quantified for material discovery problems that can take
decades. Our approach demonstrates a potential reduction in discovery time by
approximately 75 %, equivalent to a 15 year acceleration in material
innovation. Our pipeline enables us to extract data from greater than 3300
papers which is $\sim$5 times larger and therefore more diverse than similar
data sets reported by others. We also trained machine learning models to
predict the power conversion efficiency and used our model to identify
promising donor-acceptor combinations that are as yet unreported. We thus
demonstrate a pipeline that goes from published literature to extracted
material property data which in turn is used to obtain data-driven insights.
Our insights include active learning strategies that can be used to train
strong predictive models of material properties or be robust to the initial
material system used. This work provides a valuable framework for data-driven
research in materials science.

Homological Convolutional Neural Networks,"  Deep learning methods have demonstrated outstanding performances on
classification and regression tasks on homogeneous data types (e.g., image,
audio, and text data). However, tabular data still pose a challenge, with
classic machine learning approaches being often computationally cheaper and
equally effective than increasingly complex deep learning architectures. The
challenge arises from the fact that, in tabular data, the correlation among
features is weaker than the one from spatial or semantic relationships in
images or natural language, and the dependency structures need to be modeled
without any prior information. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
architecture that exploits the data structural organization through
topologically constrained network representations to gain relational
information from sparse tabular inputs. The resulting model leverages the power
of convolution and is centered on a limited number of concepts from network
topology to guarantee: (i) a data-centric and deterministic building pipeline;
(ii) a high level of interpretability over the inference process; and (iii) an
adequate room for scalability. We test our model on 18 benchmark datasets
against 5 classic machine learning and 3 deep learning models, demonstrating
that our approach reaches state-of-the-art performances on these challenging
datasets. The code to reproduce all our experiments is provided at

Evolutionary Algorithm for Sinhala to English Translation,"  Machine Translation (MT) is an area in natural language processing, which
focus on translating from one language to another. Many approaches ranging from
statistical methods to deep learning approaches are used in order to achieve
MT. However, these methods either require a large number of data or a clear
understanding about the language. Sinhala language has less digital text which
could be used to train a deep neural network. Furthermore, Sinhala has complex
rules therefore, it is harder to create statistical rules in order to apply
statistical methods in MT. This research focuses on Sinhala to English
translation using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). EA is used to identifying the
correct meaning of Sinhala text and to translate it to English. The Sinhala
text is passed to identify the meaning in order to get the correct meaning of

"Semantics of the Black-Box: Can knowledge graphs help make deep learning
  systems more interpretable and explainable?","  The recent series of innovations in deep learning (DL) have shown enormous
potential to impact individuals and society, both positively and negatively.
The DL models utilizing massive computing power and enormous datasets have
significantly outperformed prior historical benchmarks on increasingly
difficult, well-defined research tasks across technology domains such as
computer vision, natural language processing, signal processing, and
human-computer interactions. However, the Black-Box nature of DL models and

necessitated knowledge-infused learning and other strategies to incorporate
computational knowledge. This article demonstrates how knowledge, provided as a
knowledge graph, is incorporated into DL methods using knowledge-infused
learning, which is one of the strategies. We then discuss how this makes a
fundamental difference in the interpretability and explainability of current

Key Information Extraction From Documents: Evaluation And Generator,"  Extracting information from documents usually relies on natural language
processing methods working on one-dimensional sequences of text. In some cases,
for example, for the extraction of key information from semi-structured
documents, such as invoice-documents, spatial and formatting information of
text are crucial to understand the contextual meaning. Convolutional neural
networks are already common in computer vision models to process and extract
relationships in multidimensional data. Therefore, natural language processing
models have already been combined with computer vision models in the past, to
benefit from e.g. positional information and to improve performance of these
key information extraction models. Existing models were either trained on
unpublished data sets or on an annotated collection of receipts, which did not
focus on PDF-like documents. Hence, in this research project a template-based
document generator was created to compare state-of-the-art models for
information extraction. An existing information extraction model ""Chargrid""
(Katti et al., 2019) was reconstructed and the impact of a bounding box
regression decoder, as well as the impact of an NLP pre-processing step was
evaluated for information extraction from documents. The results have shown
that NLP based pre-processing is beneficial for model performance. However, the

"To Compress, or Not to Compress: Characterizing Deep Learning Model
  Compression for Embedded Inference","  The recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) make them attractive for
embedded systems. However, it can take a long time for DNNs to make an
inference on resource-constrained computing devices. Model compression
techniques can address the computation issue of deep inference on embedded
devices. This technique is highly attractive, as it does not rely on
specialized hardware, or computation-offloading that is often infeasible due to
privacy concerns or high latency. However, it remains unclear how model
compression techniques perform across a wide range of DNNs. To design efficient
embedded deep learning solutions, we need to understand their behaviors. This
work develops a quantitative approach to characterize model compression
techniques on a representative embedded deep learning architecture, the NVIDIA
Jetson Tx2. We perform extensive experiments by considering 11 influential
neural network architectures from the image classification and the natural
language processing domains. We experimentally show that how two mainstream
compression techniques, data quantization and pruning, perform on these network
architectures and the implications of compression techniques to the model
storage size, inference time, energy consumption and performance metrics. We
demonstrate that there are opportunities to achieve fast deep inference on
embedded systems, but one must carefully choose the compression settings. Our
results provide insights on when and how to apply model compression techniques
and guidelines for designing efficient embedded deep learning systems.

A Survey on Silicon Photonics for Deep Learning,"  Deep learning has led to unprecedented successes in solving some very
difficult problems in domains such as computer vision, natural language
processing, and general pattern recognition. These achievements are the
culmination of decades-long research into better training techniques and deeper
neural network models, as well as improvements in hardware platforms that are
used to train and execute the deep neural network models. Many
application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hardware accelerators for deep
learning have garnered interest in recent years due to their improved
performance and energy-efficiency over conventional CPU and GPU architectures.
However, these accelerators are constrained by fundamental bottlenecks due to
1) the slowdown in CMOS scaling, which has limited computational and
performance-per-watt capabilities of emerging electronic processors, and 2) the
use of metallic interconnects for data movement, which do not scale well and
are a major cause of bandwidth, latency, and energy inefficiencies in almost
every contemporary processor. Silicon photonics has emerged as a promising
CMOS-compatible alternative to realize a new generation of deep learning
accelerators that can use light for both communication and computation. This
article surveys the landscape of silicon photonics to accelerate deep learning,
with a coverage of developments across design abstractions in a bottom-up
manner, to convey both the capabilities and limitations of the silicon
photonics paradigm in the context of deep learning acceleration.

"Semi-automatic Generation of Multilingual Datasets for Stance Detection
  in Twitter","  Popular social media networks provide the perfect environment to study the
opinions and attitudes expressed by users. While interactions in social media
such as Twitter occur in many natural languages, research on stance detection
(the position or attitude expressed with respect to a specific topic) within
the Natural Language Processing field has largely been done for English.
Although some efforts have recently been made to develop annotated data in
other languages, there is a telling lack of resources to facilitate
multilingual and crosslingual research on stance detection. This is partially
due to the fact that manually annotating a corpus of social media texts is a
difficult, slow and costly process. Furthermore, as stance is a highly domain-
and topic-specific phenomenon, the need for annotated data is specially
demanding. As a result, most of the manually labeled resources are hindered by
their relatively small size and skewed class distribution. This paper presents
a method to obtain multilingual datasets for stance detection in Twitter.
Instead of manually annotating on a per tweet basis, we leverage user-based
information to semi-automatically label large amounts of tweets. Empirical
monolingual and cross-lingual experimentation and qualitative analysis show
that our method helps to overcome the aforementioned difficulties to build
large, balanced and multilingual labeled corpora. We believe that our method
can be easily adapted to easily generate labeled social media data for other
Natural Language Processing tasks and domains.

into the reasoning process of black-box models, such as deep neural networks,

In this work, we show how to incorporate XAI in a conversational agent, using a

"Text Mining for Processing Interview Data in Computational Social
  Science","  We use commercially available text analysis technology to process interview
text data from a computational social science study. We find that topical
clustering and terminological enrichment provide for convenient exploration and
quantification of the responses. This makes it possible to generate and test
hypotheses and to compare textual and non-textual variables, and saves analyst
effort. We encourage studies in social science to use text analysis, especially
for exploratory open-ended studies. We discuss how replicability requirements
are met by text analysis technology. We note that the most recent learning
models are not designed with transparency in mind, and that research requires a
model to be editable and its decisions to be explainable. The tools available
today, such as the one used in the present study, are not built for processing
interview texts. While many of the variables under consideration are
quantifiable using lexical statistics, we find that some interesting and
potentially valuable features are difficult or impossible to automatise
reliably at present. We note that there are some potentially interesting
applications for traditional natural language processing mechanisms such as
named entity recognition and anaphora resolution in this application area. We
conclude with a suggestion for language technologists to investigate the
challenge of processing interview data comprehensively, especially the

"Semantic maps and metrics for science Semantic maps and metrics for
  science using deep transformer encoders","  The growing deluge of scientific publications demands text analysis tools
that can help scientists and policy-makers navigate, forecast and beneficially
guide scientific research. Recent advances in natural language understanding
driven by deep transformer networks offer new possibilities for mapping
science. Because the same surface text can take on multiple and sometimes
contradictory specialized senses across distinct research communities,
sensitivity to context is critical for infometric applications. Transformer
embedding models such as BERT capture shades of association and connotation
that vary across the different linguistic contexts of any particular word or
span of text. Here we report a procedure for encoding scientific documents with
these tools, measuring their improvement over static word embeddings in a
nearest-neighbor retrieval task. We find discriminability of contextual
representations is strongly influenced by choice of pooling strategy for
summarizing the high-dimensional network activations. Importantly, we note that
fundamentals such as domain-matched training data are more important than
state-of-the-art NLP tools. Yet state-of-the-art models did offer significant
gains. The best approach we investigated combined domain-matched pretraining,
sound pooling, and state-of-the-art deep transformer network encoders. Finally,
with the goal of leveraging contextual representations from deep encoders, we
present a range of measurements for understanding and forecasting research
communities in science.

"Listen, Interact and Talk: Learning to Speak via Interaction","  One of the long-term goals of artificial intelligence is to build an agent
that can communicate intelligently with human in natural language. Most
existing work on natural language learning relies heavily on training over a
pre-collected dataset with annotated labels, leading to an agent that
essentially captures the statistics of the fixed external training data. As the
training data is essentially a static snapshot representation of the knowledge
from the annotator, the agent trained this way is limited in adaptiveness and
generalization of its behavior. Moreover, this is very different from the
language learning process of humans, where language is acquired during
communication by taking speaking action and learning from the consequences of
speaking action in an interactive manner. This paper presents an interactive
setting for grounded natural language learning, where an agent learns natural
language by interacting with a teacher and learning from feedback, thus
learning and improving language skills while taking part in the conversation.
To achieve this goal, we propose a model which incorporates both imitation and
reinforcement by leveraging jointly sentence and reward feedbacks from the
teacher. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

"On the Linguistic Representational Power of Neural Machine Translation
  Models","  Despite the recent success of deep neural networks in natural language
processing (NLP), their interpretability remains a challenge. We analyze the
representations learned by neural machine translation models at various levels
of granularity and evaluate their quality through relevant extrinsic
properties. In particular, we seek answers to the following questions: (i) How
accurately is word-structure captured within the learned representations, an
important aspect in translating morphologically-rich languages? (ii) Do the
representations capture long-range dependencies, and effectively handle
syntactically divergent languages? (iii) Do the representations capture lexical
semantics? We conduct a thorough investigation along several parameters: (i)
Which layers in the architecture capture each of these linguistic phenomena;
(ii) How does the choice of translation unit (word, character, or subword unit)
impact the linguistic properties captured by the underlying representations?
(iii) Do the encoder and decoder learn differently and independently? (iv) Do
the representations learned by multilingual NMT models capture the same amount
of linguistic information as their bilingual counterparts? Our data-driven,
quantitative evaluation illuminates important aspects in NMT models and their
ability to capture various linguistic phenomena. We show that deep NMT models
learn a non-trivial amount of linguistic information. Notable findings include:
i) Word morphology and part-of-speech information are captured at the lower
layers of the model; (ii) In contrast, lexical semantics or non-local syntactic
and semantic dependencies are better represented at the higher layers; (iii)
Representations learned using characters are more informed about wordmorphology
compared to those learned using subword units; and (iv) Representations learned
by multilingual models are richer compared to bilingual models.

"Towards Enhancing Database Education: Natural Language Generation Meets
  Query Execution Plans","  The database systems course is offered as part of an undergraduate computer
science degree program in many major universities. A key learning goal of
learners taking such a course is to understand how SQL queries are processed in
a RDBMS in practice. Since a query execution plan (QEP) describes the execution
steps of a query, learners can acquire the understanding by perusing the QEPs
generated by a RDBMS. Unfortunately, in practice, it is often daunting for a
learner to comprehend these QEPs containing vendor-specific implementation
details, hindering her learning process. In this paper, we present a novel,
end-to-end, generic system called lantern that generates a natural language
description of a qep to facilitate understanding of the query execution steps.
It takes as input an SQL query and its QEP, and generates a natural language
description of the execution strategy deployed by the underlying RDBMS.
Specifically, it deploys a declarative framework called pool that enables
subject matter experts to efficiently create and maintain natural language
descriptions of physical operators used in QEPs. A rule-based framework called
RULE-LANTERN is proposed that exploits pool to generate natural language
descriptions of QEPs. Despite the high accuracy of RULE-LANTERN, our engagement
with learners reveal that, consistent with existing psychology theories,
perusing such rule-based descriptions lead to boredom due to repetitive
statements across different QEPs. To address this issue, we present a novel
deep learning-based language generation framework called NEURAL-LANTERN that
infuses language variability in the generated description by exploiting a set
of paraphrasing tools and word embedding. Our experimental study with real
learners shows the effectiveness of lantern in facilitating comprehension of
QEPs.

Transfer Learning for Speech and Language Processing,"  Transfer learning is a vital technique that generalizes models trained for
one setting or task to other settings or tasks. For example in speech
recognition, an acoustic model trained for one language can be used to
recognize speech in another language, with little or no re-training data.
Transfer learning is closely related to multi-task learning (cross-lingual vs.
multilingual), and is traditionally studied in the name of `model adaptation'.
Recent advance in deep learning shows that transfer learning becomes much
easier and more effective with high-level abstract features learned by deep
models, and the `transfer' can be conducted not only between data distributions
and data types, but also between model structures (e.g., shallow nets and deep
nets) or even model types (e.g., Bayesian models and neural models). This

brain research, and neurological disease studies. However, susceptibility to
various physiological and environmental artifacts introduces noise in recorded
EEG data, impeding accurate analysis of underlying brain activity. Denoising
techniques are crucial to mitigate this challenge. Recent advancements in deep

Nonetheless, direct application of Retnet to EEG denoising is unfeasible due to
the one-dimensional nature of EEG signals, while natural language processing
deals with two-dimensional data. To facilitate Retnet application to EEG
denoising, we propose the signal embedding method, transforming one-dimensional

"Rethinking Tokenization: Crafting Better Tokenizers for Large Language
  Models","  Tokenization significantly influences language models(LMs)' performance. This
paper traces the evolution of tokenizers from word-level to subword-level,
analyzing how they balance tokens and types to enhance model adaptability while
controlling complexity. Despite subword tokenizers like Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE) overcoming many word tokenizer limitations, they encounter difficulties
in handling non-Latin languages and depend heavily on extensive training data
and computational resources to grasp the nuances of multiword expressions
(MWEs). This article argues that tokenizers, more than mere technical tools,
should drawing inspiration from the cognitive science about human language
processing. This study then introduces the ""Principle of Least Effort"" from
cognitive science, that humans naturally seek to reduce cognitive effort, and
discusses the benefits of this principle for tokenizer development. Based on
this principle, the paper proposes that the Less-is-Better (LiB) model could be
a new approach for LLM tokenizer. The LiB model can autonomously learn an
integrated vocabulary consisting of subwords, words, and MWEs, which
effectively reduces both the numbers of tokens and types. Comparative
evaluations show that the LiB tokenizer outperforms existing word and BPE
tokenizers, presenting an innovative method for tokenizer development, and
hinting at the possibility of future cognitive science-based tokenizers being
more efficient.

"MetaPred: Meta-Learning for Clinical Risk Prediction with Limited
  Patient Electronic Health Records","  In recent years, increasingly augmentation of health data, such as patient
Electronic Health Records (EHR), are becoming readily available. This provides
an unprecedented opportunity for knowledge discovery and data mining algorithms
to dig insights from them, which can, later on, be helpful to the improvement
of the quality of care delivery. Predictive modeling of clinical risk,
including in-hospital mortality, hospital readmission, chronic disease onset,
condition exacerbation, etc., from patient EHR, is one of the health data
analytic problems that attract most of the interests. The reason is not only
because the problem is important in clinical settings, but also there are
challenges working with EHR such as sparsity, irregularity, temporality, etc.
Different from applications in other domains such as computer vision and
natural language processing, the labeled data samples in medicine (patients)
are relatively limited, which creates lots of troubles for effective predictive
model learning, especially for complicated models such as deep learning. In
this paper, we propose MetaPred, a meta-learning for clinical risk prediction
from longitudinal patient EHRs. In particular, in order to predict the target
risk where there are limited data samples, we train a meta-learner from a set
of related risk prediction tasks which learns how a good predictor is learned.
The meta-learned can then be directly used in target risk prediction, and the
limited available samples can be used for further fine-tuning the model
performance. The effectiveness of MetaPred is tested on a real patient EHR
repository from Oregon Health & Science University. We are able to demonstrate
that with CNN and RNN as base predictors, MetaPred can achieve much better
performance for predicting target risk with low resources comparing with the
predictor trained on the limited samples available for this risk.

addition and removal of unwanted tokens like punctuation and stop-words that
are minimally associated with the final performance of the model. We show that
these deep learning approaches including BERT are sensitive to such legitimate
input perturbations on four standard benchmark datasets SST2, TREC-6, BBC News,
and tweet_eval. We observe that BERT is more susceptible to the removal of
tokens as compared to the addition of tokens. Moreover, LSTM is slightly more
sensitive to input perturbations as compared to CNN based model. The work also
serves as a practical guide to assessing the impact of discrepancies in
train-test conditions on the final performance of models.

inadequate decoder by using an additional language model for the evaluation of
the generated text in target language. We test several cross-lingual
summarization models with different amounts of target data for fine-tuning. We
assess the models with automatic evaluation measures and conduct a small-scale
human evaluation. Automatic evaluation shows that the summaries of our best
cross-lingual model are useful and of quality similar to the model trained only
in the target language. Human evaluation shows that our best model generates
summaries with high accuracy and acceptable readability. However, similar to
other abstractive models, our models are not perfect and may occasionally
produce misleading or absurd content.

"Analyzing Deep Transformer Models for Time Series Forecasting via
  Manifold Learning","  Transformer models have consistently achieved remarkable results in various
domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. However,
despite ongoing research efforts to better understand these models, the field
still lacks a comprehensive understanding. This is particularly true for deep
time series forecasting methods, where analysis and understanding work is
relatively limited. Time series data, unlike image and text information, can be
more challenging to interpret and analyze. To address this, we approach the
problem from a manifold learning perspective, assuming that the latent
representations of time series forecasting models lie next to a low-dimensional
manifold. In our study, we focus on analyzing the geometric features of these
latent data manifolds, including intrinsic dimension and principal curvatures.
Our findings reveal that deep transformer models exhibit similar geometric
behavior across layers, and these geometric features are correlated with model
performance. Additionally, we observe that untrained models initially have
different structures, but they rapidly converge during training. By leveraging
our geometric analysis and differentiable tools, we can potentially design new
and improved deep forecasting neural networks. This approach complements
existing analysis studies and contributes to a better understanding of
transformer models in the context of time series forecasting. Code is released
at https://github.com/azencot-group/GATLM.

"How to keep text private? A systematic review of deep learning methods
  for privacy-preserving natural language processing","  Deep learning (DL) models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks often
handle private data, demanding protection against breaches and disclosures.
Data protection laws, such as the European Union's General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR), thereby enforce the need for privacy. Although many
privacy-preserving NLP methods have been proposed in recent years, no
categories to organize them have been introduced yet, making it hard to follow
the progress of the literature. To close this gap, this article systematically
reviews over sixty DL methods for privacy-preserving NLP published between 2016
and 2020, covering theoretical foundations, privacy-enhancing technologies, and
analysis of their suitability for real-world scenarios. First, we introduce a
novel taxonomy for classifying the existing methods into three categories: data
safeguarding methods, trusted methods, and verification methods. Second, we
present an extensive summary of privacy threats, datasets for applications, and
metrics for privacy evaluation. Third, throughout the review, we describe
privacy issues in the NLP pipeline in a holistic view. Further, we discuss open
challenges in privacy-preserving NLP regarding data traceability, computation
overhead, dataset size, the prevalence of human biases in embeddings, and the
privacy-utility tradeoff. Finally, this review presents future research
directions to guide successive research and development of privacy-preserving
NLP models.

Hindi to English: Transformer-Based Neural Machine Translation,"  Machine Translation (MT) is one of the most prominent tasks in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) which involves the automatic conversion of texts from
one natural language to another while preserving its meaning and fluency.
Although the research in machine translation has been going on since multiple
decades, the newer approach of integrating deep learning techniques in natural
language processing has led to significant improvements in the translation
quality. In this paper, we have developed a Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
system by training the Transformer model to translate texts from Indian
Language Hindi to English. Hindi being a low resource language has made it
difficult for neural networks to understand the language thereby leading to a
slow growth in the development of neural machine translators. Thus, to address
this gap, we implemented back-translation to augment the training data and for
creating the vocabulary, we experimented with both word and subword level
tokenization using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) thereby ending up training the
Transformer in 10 different configurations. This led us to achieve a

"Long-range and hierarchical language predictions in brains and
  algorithms","  Deep learning has recently made remarkable progress in natural language
processing. Yet, the resulting algorithms remain far from competing with the
language abilities of the human brain. Predictive coding theory offers a
potential explanation to this discrepancy: while deep language algorithms are
optimized to predict adjacent words, the human brain would be tuned to make
long-range and hierarchical predictions. To test this hypothesis, we analyze
the fMRI brain signals of 304 subjects each listening to 70min of short
stories. After confirming that the activations of deep language algorithms
linearly map onto those of the brain, we show that enhancing these models with
long-range forecast representations improves their brain-mapping. The results
further reveal a hierarchy of predictions in the brain, whereby the
fronto-parietal cortices forecast more abstract and more distant
representations than the temporal cortices. Overall, this study strengthens
predictive coding theory and suggests a critical role of long-range and
hierarchical predictions in natural language processing.

"Continuous Sign Language Recognition with Adapted Conformer via
  Unsupervised Pretraining","  Conventional Deep Learning frameworks for continuous sign language
recognition (CSLR) are comprised of a single or multi-modal feature extractor,
a sequence-learning module, and a decoder for outputting the glosses. The
sequence learning module is a crucial part wherein transformers have
demonstrated their efficacy in the sequence-to-sequence tasks. Analyzing the
research progress in the field of Natural Language Processing and Speech
Recognition, a rapid introduction of various transformer variants is observed.
However, in the realm of sign language, experimentation in the sequence
learning component is limited. In this work, the state-of-the-art Conformer
model for Speech Recognition is adapted for CSLR and the proposed model is
termed ConSignformer. This marks the first instance of employing Conformer for
a vision-based task. ConSignformer has bimodal pipeline of CNN as feature
extractor and Conformer for sequence learning. For improved context learning we
also introduce Cross-Modal Relative Attention (CMRA). By incorporating CMRA
into the model, it becomes more adept at learning and utilizing complex
relationships within the data. To further enhance the Conformer model,
unsupervised pretraining called Regressional Feature Extraction is conducted on
a curated sign language dataset. The pretrained Conformer is then fine-tuned
for the downstream recognition task. The experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of the adopted pretraining strategy and demonstrate how CMRA
contributes to the recognition process. Remarkably, leveraging a

best on large corpora of data. When processing EEG, a natural approach is to
combine EEG datasets from different experiments to train large deep-learning

the data to be transformed into a common space. Previous methods have used the
raw EEG signal to extract features of interest and focused on using a common
feature space across EEG datasets. While this is a sensible approach, it
underexploits the potential richness of EEG raw data. Here, we explore using
spatial attention applied to EEG electrode coordinates to perform channel
harmonization of raw EEG data, allowing us to train deep learning on EEG data
using different montages. We test this model on a gender classification task.

that a deep learning model trained on data using different channel montages

and 128-channel data montages.

"Active$^2$ Learning: Actively reducing redundancies in Active Learning

"Outlier Gradient Analysis: Efficiently Identifying Detrimental Training

samples that are detrimental to model performance. Influence functions serve as
a prominent tool for this task and offer a robust framework for assessing

"Automated Medical Report Generation for ECG Data: Bridging Medical Text
  and Signal Processing with Deep Learning","  Recent advances in deep learning and natural language generation have
significantly improved image captioning, enabling automated, human-like
descriptions for visual content. In this work, we apply these captioning
techniques to generate clinician-like interpretations of ECG data. This study
leverages existing ECG datasets accompanied by free-text reports authored by
healthcare professionals (HCPs) as training data. These reports, while often
inconsistent, provide a valuable foundation for automated learning. We
introduce an encoder-decoder-based method that uses these reports to train
models to generate detailed descriptions of ECG episodes. This represents a
significant advancement in ECG analysis automation, with potential applications
in zero-shot classification and automated clinical decision support.
  The model is tested on various datasets, including both 1- and 12-lead ECGs.
It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art reference model by Qiu et
al., achieving a METEOR score of 55.53% compared to 24.51% achieved by the
reference model. Furthermore, several key design choices are discussed,
providing a comprehensive overview of current challenges and innovations in
this domain.

"The NLP Cookbook: Modern Recipes for Transformer based Deep Learning
  Architectures","  In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have achieved
phenomenal success in linguistic and semantic tasks like text classification,
machine translation, cognitive dialogue systems, information retrieval via
Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Natural Language Generation (NLG).
This feat is primarily attributed due to the seminal Transformer architecture,
leading to designs such as BERT, GPT (I, II, III), etc. Although these
large-size models have achieved unprecedented performances, they come at high
computational costs. Consequently, some of the recent NLP architectures have
utilized concepts of transfer learning, pruning, quantization, and knowledge
distillation to achieve moderate model sizes while keeping nearly similar
performances as achieved by their predecessors. Additionally, to mitigate the
data size challenge raised by language models from a knowledge extraction
perspective, Knowledge Retrievers have been built to extricate explicit data
documents from a large corpus of databases with greater efficiency and
accuracy. Recent research has also focused on superior inference by providing
efficient attention to longer input sequences. In this paper, we summarize and
examine the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) NLP models that have been employed
for numerous NLP tasks for optimal performance and efficiency. We provide a
detailed understanding and functioning of the different architectures, a
taxonomy of NLP designs, comparative evaluations, and future directions in NLP.

"Improving Entity Recognition Using Ensembles of Deep Learning and
  Fine-tuned Large Language Models: A Case Study on Adverse Event Extraction
  from Multiple Sources","  Adverse event (AE) extraction following COVID-19 vaccines from text data is
crucial for monitoring and analyzing the safety profiles of immunizations.
Traditional deep learning models are adept at learning intricate feature
representations and dependencies in sequential data, but often require
extensive labeled data. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) excel in
understanding contextual information, but exhibit unstable performance on named
entity recognition tasks, possibly due to their broad but unspecific training.
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs and traditional deep
learning models in AE extraction, and to assess the impact of ensembling these
models on performance. In this study, we utilized reports and posts from the
VAERS (n=621), Twitter (n=9,133), and Reddit (n=131) as our corpora. Our goal
was to extract three types of entities: ""vaccine"", ""shot"", and ""ae"". We
explored and fine-tuned (except GPT-4) multiple LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3.5,
GPT-4, and Llama-2, as well as traditional deep learning models like RNN and
BioBERT. To enhance performance, we created ensembles of the three models with
the best performance. For evaluation, we used strict and relaxed F1 scores to
evaluate the performance for each entity type, and micro-average F1 was used to
assess the overall performance. The ensemble model achieved the highest
performance in ""vaccine"", ""shot"", and ""ae"" with strict F1-scores of 0.878,
0.930, and 0.925, respectively, along with a micro-average score of 0.903. In
conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of
ensembling fine-tuned traditional deep learning models and LLMs, for extracting
AE-related information. This study contributes to the advancement of biomedical
natural language processing, providing valuable insights into improving AE
extraction from text data for pharmacovigilance and public health surveillance.

"Automated Multi-Language to English Machine Translation Using Generative
  Pre-Trained Transformers","  The task of accurate and efficient language translation is an extremely
important information processing task. Machine learning enabled and automated
translation that is accurate and fast is often a large topic of interest in the
machine learning and data science communities. In this study, we examine using
local Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models to perform automated zero

text. We benchmark 16 different open-source GPT models, with no custom
fine-tuning, from the Huggingface LLM repository for translating 50 different
non-English languages into English using translated TED Talk transcripts as the

locally, on single A100 Nvidia GPUs. Benchmark metrics that are reported are
language translation accuracy, using BLEU, GLEU, METEOR, and chrF text overlap

"Profile Prediction: An Alignment-Based Pre-Training Task for Protein
  Sequence Models","  For protein sequence datasets, unlabeled data has greatly outpaced labeled
data due to the high cost of wet-lab characterization. Recent deep-learning
approaches to protein prediction have shown that pre-training on unlabeled data

pre-training strategy remains an open question. Instead of strictly borrowing
from natural language processing (NLP) in the form of masked or autoregressive
language modeling, we introduce a new pre-training task: directly predicting
protein profiles derived from multiple sequence alignments. Using a set of
five, standardized downstream tasks for protein models, we demonstrate that our
pre-training task along with a multi-task objective outperforms masked language
modeling alone on all five tasks. Our results suggest that protein sequence

An Integrated Approach for Video Captioning and Applications,"  Physical computing infrastructure, data gathering, and algorithms have
recently had significant advances to extract information from images and
videos. The growth has been especially outstanding in image captioning and
video captioning. However, most of the advancements in video captioning still
take place in short videos. In this research, we caption longer videos only by
using the keyframes, which are a small subset of the total video frames.
Instead of processing thousands of frames, only a few frames are processed
depending on the number of keyframes. There is a trade-off between the
computation of many frames and the speed of the captioning process. The
approach in this research is to allow the user to specify the trade-off between
execution time and accuracy. In addition, we argue that linking images, videos,
and natural language offers many practical benefits and immediate practical
applications. From the modeling perspective, instead of designing and staging
explicit algorithms to process videos and generate captions in complex
processing pipelines, our contribution lies in designing hybrid deep learning
architectures to apply in long videos by captioning video keyframes. We
consider the technology and the methodology that we have developed as steps
toward the applications discussed in this research.

A Multimodal Approach for Advanced Pest Detection and Classification,"  This paper presents a novel multi modal deep learning framework for enhanced
agricultural pest detection, combining tiny-BERT's natural language processing

traditional CNN-based visual methods, this approach integrates textual context
for more accurate pest identification. The R-CNN and ResNet-18 integration
tackles deep CNN issues like vanishing gradients, while tiny-BERT ensures
computational efficiency. Employing ensemble learning with linear regression
and random forest models, the framework demonstrates superior discriminate
ability, as shown in ROC and AUC analyses. This multi modal approach, blending

"Temporal Embeddings and Transformer Models for Narrative Text
  Understanding","  We present two deep learning approaches to narrative text understanding for
character relationship modelling. The temporal evolution of these relations is
described by dynamic word embeddings, that are designed to learn semantic
changes over time. An empirical analysis of the corresponding character
trajectories shows that such approaches are effective in depicting dynamic
evolution. A supervised learning approach based on the state-of-the-art
transformer model BERT is used instead to detect static relations between
characters. The empirical validation shows that such events (e.g., two
characters belonging to the same family) might be spotted with good accuracy,
even when using automatically annotated data. This provides a deeper
understanding of narrative plots based on the identification of key facts.
Standard clustering techniques are finally used for character de-aliasing, a
necessary pre-processing step for both approaches. Overall, deep learning
models appear to be suitable for narrative text understanding, while also
providing a challenging and unexploited benchmark for general natural language
understanding.

"Implications of Deep Circuits in Improving Quality of Quantum Question
  Answering","  Question Answering (QA) has proved to be an arduous challenge in the area of
natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI). Many
attempts have been made to develop complete solutions for QA as well as
improving significant sub-modules of the QA systems to improve the overall
performance through the course of time. Questions are the most important piece
of QA, because knowing the question is equivalent to knowing what counts as an

on questions from two classes of SelQA (Selection-based Question Answering)

machine (QSVM) and variational quantum classifier (VQC) from Qiskit (Quantum
Information Science toolKIT) for Python. We perform classification with both
classifiers in almost similar environments and study the effects of circuit
depths while comparing the results of both classifiers. We also use these
classification results with our own rule-based QA system and observe
significant performance improvement. Hence, this experiment has helped in
improving the quality of QA in general.

Self-Supervised Speech Representation Learning: A Review,"  Although supervised deep learning has revolutionized speech and audio
processing, it has necessitated the building of specialist models for
individual tasks and application scenarios. It is likewise difficult to apply
this to dialects and languages for which only limited labeled data is
available. Self-supervised representation learning methods promise a single
universal model that would benefit a wide variety of tasks and domains. Such
methods have shown success in natural language processing and computer vision
domains, achieving new levels of performance while reducing the number of
labels required for many downstream scenarios. Speech representation learning
is experiencing similar progress in three main categories: generative,
contrastive, and predictive methods. Other approaches rely on multi-modal data
for pre-training, mixing text or visual data streams with speech. Although
self-supervised speech representation is still a nascent research area, it is
closely related to acoustic word embedding and learning with zero lexical
resources, both of which have seen active research for many years. This review
presents approaches for self-supervised speech representation learning and
their connection to other research areas. Since many current methods focus
solely on automatic speech recognition as a downstream task, we review recent
efforts on benchmarking learned representations to extend the application
beyond speech recognition.

SELFormer: Molecular Representation Learning via SELFIES Language Models,"  Automated computational analysis of the vast chemical space is critical for
numerous fields of research such as drug discovery and material science.
Representation learning techniques have recently been employed with the primary
objective of generating compact and informative numerical expressions of
complex data. One approach to efficiently learn molecular representations is
processing string-based notations of chemicals via natural language processing
(NLP) algorithms. Majority of the methods proposed so far utilize SMILES
notations for this purpose; however, SMILES is associated with numerous
problems related to validity and robustness, which may prevent the model from
effectively uncovering the knowledge hidden in the data. In this study, we
propose SELFormer, a transformer architecture-based chemical language model
that utilizes a 100% valid, compact and expressive notation, SELFIES, as input,
in order to learn flexible and high-quality molecular representations.
SELFormer is pre-trained on two million drug-like compounds and fine-tuned for
diverse molecular property prediction tasks. Our performance evaluation has
revealed that, SELFormer outperforms all competing methods, including graph
learning-based approaches and SMILES-based chemical language models, on
predicting aqueous solubility of molecules and adverse drug reactions. We also
visualized molecular representations learned by SELFormer via dimensionality
reduction, which indicated that even the pre-trained model can discriminate
molecules with differing structural properties. We shared SELFormer as a

"Towards a neural architecture of language: Deep learning versus
  logistics of access in neural architectures for compositional processing","  Recently, a number of articles have argued that deep learning models such as
GPT could also capture key aspects of language processing in the human mind and
brain. However, I will argue that these models are not suitable as neural
models of human language. Firstly, because they fail on fundamental boundary
conditions, such as the amount of learning they require. This would in fact
imply that the mechanisms of GPT and brain language processing are
fundamentally different. Secondly, because they do not possess the logistics of
access needed for compositional and productive human language processing.
Neural architectures could possess logistics of access based on small-world
like network structures, in which processing does not consist of symbol
manipulation but of controlling the flow of activation. In this view, two
complementary approaches would be needed to investigate the relation between
brain and cognition. Investigating learning methods could reveal how 'learned
cognition' as found in deep learning could develop in the brain. However,
neural architectures with logistics of access should also be developed to
account for 'productive cognition' as required for natural or artificial human
language processing. Later on, these approaches could perhaps be combined to
see how such architectures could develop by learning and development from a
simpler basis.

Interpreting Deep Neural Networks Through Variable Importance,"  While the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) is well-established across a
variety of domains, our ability to explain and interpret these methods is
limited. Unlike previously proposed local methods which try to explain
particular classification decisions, we focus on global interpretability and
ask a universally applicable question: given a trained model, which features
are the most important? In the context of neural networks, a feature is rarely
important on its own, so our strategy is specifically designed to leverage
partial covariance structures and incorporate variable dependence into feature
ranking. Our methodological contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose an effect size analogue for DNNs that is appropriate for applications
with highly collinear predictors (ubiquitous in computer vision). Second, we
extend the recently proposed ""RelATive cEntrality"" (RATE) measure (Crawford et
al., 2019) to the Bayesian deep learning setting. RATE applies an information
theoretic criterion to the posterior distribution of effect sizes to assess
feature significance. We apply our framework to three broad application areas:
computer vision, natural language processing, and social science.

"Harnessing the Power of Beta Scoring in Deep Active Learning for

are then transformed into sample vector representations. These vector
representations guide the diverse selection of informative samples, directly

"LinkTransformer: A Unified Package for Record Linkage with Transformer
  Language Models","  Linking information across sources is fundamental to a variety of analyses in
social science, business, and government. While large language models (LLMs)
offer enormous promise for improving record linkage in noisy datasets, in many
domains approximate string matching packages in popular softwares such as R and
Stata remain predominant. These packages have clean, simple interfaces and can
be easily extended to a diversity of languages. Our open-source package
LinkTransformer aims to extend the familiarity and ease-of-use of popular
string matching methods to deep learning. It is a general purpose package for
record linkage with transformer LLMs that treats record linkage as a text
retrieval problem. At its core is an off-the-shelf toolkit for applying
transformer models to record linkage with four lines of code. LinkTransformer
contains a rich repository of pre-trained transformer semantic similarity
models for multiple languages and supports easy integration of any transformer
language model from Hugging Face or OpenAI. It supports standard functionality
such as blocking and linking on multiple noisy fields. LinkTransformer APIs
also perform other common text data processing tasks, e.g., aggregation, noisy
de-duplication, and translation-free cross-lingual linkage. Importantly,
LinkTransformer also contains comprehensive tools for efficient model tuning,
to facilitate different levels of customization when off-the-shelf models do
not provide the required accuracy. Finally, to promote reusability,
reproducibility, and extensibility, LinkTransformer makes it easy for users to
contribute their custom-trained models to its model hub. By combining
transformer language models with intuitive APIs that will be familiar to many
users of popular string matching packages, LinkTransformer aims to democratize
the benefits of LLMs among those who may be less familiar with deep learning
frameworks.

"Nemesyst: A Hybrid Parallelism Deep Learning-Based Framework Applied for
  Internet of Things Enabled Food Retailing Refrigeration Systems","  Deep Learning has attracted considerable attention across multiple
application domains, including computer vision, signal processing and natural
language processing. Although quite a few single node deep learning frameworks
exist, such as tensorflow, pytorch and keras, we still lack a complete
processing structure that can accommodate large scale data processing, version
control, and deployment, all while staying agnostic of any specific single node
framework. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a new, higher level
framework, i.e. Nemesyst, which uses databases along with model
sequentialisation to allow processes to be fed unique and transformed data at
the point of need. This facilitates near real-time application and makes models
available for further training or use at any node that has access to the
database simultaneously. Nemesyst is well suited as an application framework
for internet of things aggregated control systems, deploying deep learning
techniques to optimise individual machines in massive networks. To demonstrate
this framework, we adopted a case study in a novel domain; deploying deep
learning to optimise the high speed control of electrical power consumed by a
massive internet of things network of retail refrigeration systems in
proportion to load available on the UK National Grid (a demand side response).
The case study demonstrated for the first time in such a setting how deep
learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (vanilla and Long-Short-Term
Memory) and Generative Adversarial Networks paired with Nemesyst, achieve
compelling performance, whilst still being malleable to future adjustments as
both the data and requirements inevitably change over time.

"Deep Learning for Quantile Regression under Right Censoring:
  DeepQuantreg","  The computational prediction algorithm of neural network, or deep learning,
has drawn much attention recently in statistics as well as in image recognition
and natural language processing. Particularly in statistical application for
censored survival data, the loss function used for optimization has been mainly
based on the partial likelihood from Cox's model and its variations to utilize
existing neural network library such as Keras, which was built upon the open
source library of TensorFlow. This paper presents a novel application of the
neural network to the quantile regression for survival data with right
censoring, which is adjusted by the inverse of the estimated censoring
distribution in the check function. The main purpose of this work is to show
that the deep learning method could be flexible enough to predict nonlinear
patterns more accurately compared to existing quantile regression methods such
as traditional linear quantile regression and nonparametric quantile regression
with total variation regularization, emphasizing practicality of the method for
censored survival data. Simulation studies were performed to generate nonlinear
censored survival data and compare the deep learning method with existing
quantile regression methods in terms of prediction accuracy. The proposed
method is illustrated with two publicly available breast cancer data sets with
gene signatures. The method has been built into a package and is freely
available at \url{https://github.com/yicjia/DeepQuantreg}.

"Around the GLOBE: Numerical Aggregation Question-Answering on
  Heterogeneous Genealogical Knowledge Graphs with Deep Neural Networks","  One of the key AI tools for textual corpora exploration is natural language
question-answering (QA). Unlike keyword-based search engines, QA algorithms
receive and process natural language questions and produce precise answers to
these questions, rather than long lists of documents that need to be manually
scanned by the users. State-of-the-art QA algorithms based on DNNs were
successfully employed in various domains. However, QA in the genealogical
domain is still underexplored, while researchers in this field (and other
fields in humanities and social sciences) can highly benefit from the ability
to ask questions in natural language, receive concrete answers and gain
insights hidden within large corpora. While some research has been recently
conducted for factual QA in the genealogical domain, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no previous research on the more challenging task of
numerical aggregation QA (i.e., answering questions combining aggregation
functions, e.g., count, average, max). Numerical aggregation QA is critical for
distant reading and analysis for researchers (and the general public)
interested in investigating cultural heritage domains. Therefore, in this
study, we present a new end-to-end methodology for numerical aggregation QA for
genealogical trees that includes: 1) an automatic method for training dataset
generation; 2) a transformer-based table selection method, and 3) an optimized
transformer-based numerical aggregation QA model. The findings indicate that
the proposed architecture, GLOBE, outperforms the state-of-the-art models and
pipelines by achieving 87% accuracy for this task compared to only 21% by
current state-of-the-art models. This study may have practical implications for
genealogical information centers and museums, making genealogical data research
easy and scalable for experts as well as the general public.

"A natural language processing-based approach: mapping human perception
  by understanding deep semantic features in street view images","  In the past decade, using Street View images and machine learning to measure
human perception has become a mainstream research approach in urban science.
However, this approach using only image-shallow information makes it difficult
to comprehensively understand the deep semantic features of human perception of
a scene. In this study, we proposed a new framework based on a pre-train
natural language model to understand the relationship between human perception
and the sense of a scene. Firstly, Place Pulse 2.0 was used as our base
dataset, which contains a variety of human-perceived labels, namely, beautiful,
safe, wealthy, depressing, boring, and lively. An image captioning network was
used to extract the description information of each street view image.
Secondly, a pre-trained BERT model was finetuning and added a regression
function for six human perceptual dimensions. Furthermore, we compared the
performance of five traditional regression methods with our approach and
conducted a migration experiment in Hong Kong. Our results show that human
perception scoring by deep semantic features performed better than previous
studies by machine learning methods with shallow features. The use of deep
scene semantic features provides new ideas for subsequent human perception
research, as well as better explanatory power in the face of spatial
heterogeneity.

"Adaptivity of deep ReLU network for learning in Besov and mixed smooth
  Besov spaces: optimal rate and curse of dimensionality","  Deep learning has shown high performances in various types of tasks from
visual recognition to natural language processing, which indicates superior
flexibility and adaptivity of deep learning. To understand this phenomenon
theoretically, we develop a new approximation and estimation error analysis of
deep learning with the ReLU activation for functions in a Besov space and its
variant with mixed smoothness. The Besov space is a considerably general
function space including the Holder space and Sobolev space, and especially can
capture spatial inhomogeneity of smoothness. Through the analysis in the Besov
space, it is shown that deep learning can achieve the minimax optimal rate and
outperform any non-adaptive (linear) estimator such as kernel ridge regression,
which shows that deep learning has higher adaptivity to the spatial
inhomogeneity of the target function than other estimators such as linear ones.
In addition to this, it is shown that deep learning can avoid the curse of
dimensionality if the target function is in a mixed smooth Besov space. We also
show that the dependency of the convergence rate on the dimensionality is tight
due to its minimax optimality. These results support high adaptivity of deep
learning and its superior ability as a feature extractor.

"Autonomous Droplet Microfluidic Design Framework with Large Language
  Models","  Droplet-based microfluidic devices have substantial promise as cost-effective
alternatives to current assessment tools in biological research. Moreover,
machine learning models that leverage tabular data, including input design
parameters and their corresponding efficiency outputs, are increasingly
utilised to automate the design process of these devices and to predict their
performance. However, these models fail to fully leverage the data presented in
the tables, neglecting crucial contextual information, including column
headings and their associated descriptions. This study presents
MicroFluidic-LLMs, a framework designed for processing and feature extraction,
which effectively captures contextual information from tabular data formats.
MicroFluidic-LLMs overcomes processing challenges by transforming the content
into a linguistic format and leveraging pre-trained large language models
(LLMs) for analysis. We evaluate our MicroFluidic-LLMs framework on 11
prediction tasks, covering aspects such as geometry, flow conditions, regimes,
and performance, utilising a publicly available dataset on flow-focusing
droplet microfluidics. We demonstrate that our MicroFluidic-LLMs framework can
empower deep neural network models to be highly effective and straightforward
while minimising the need for extensive data preprocessing. Moreover, the
exceptional performance of deep neural network models, particularly when
combined with advanced natural language processing models such as DistilBERT
and GPT-2, reduces the mean absolute error in the droplet diameter and
generation rate by nearly 5- and 7-fold, respectively, and enhances the regime
classification accuracy by over 4%, compared with the performance reported in a
previous study. This study lays the foundation for the huge potential
applications of LLMs and machine learning in a wider spectrum of microfluidic

bridge the vast remaining fringe terms semantically. To support a fine-grained
domain without relying on a matching corpus for supervision, we develop
hierarchical core-fringe learning, which learns core and fringe terms jointly

reduce expensive human efforts, we employ automatic annotation and hierarchical

"Generating Feasible and Plausible Counterfactual Explanations for

successfully introduced to the field of predictive process analytics.
Nevertheless, the inherent opacity of these algorithms poses a significant
challenge for human decision-makers, hindering their ability to understand the

counterfactuals that lie within a high-density region of the process data,
ensuring that the proposed counterfactuals are realistic and feasible within
the observed process data distribution. Additionally, we ensure plausibility by
learning sequential patterns between the activities in the process cases,
utilising Declare language templates. Finally, we evaluate the properties that
define the validity of counterfactuals.

Natural Language processing (NLP) has been used extensively to process this
data. Deep Learning based NLP especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as
BERT have found broad acceptance and are used extensively for many
applications. A Language Model is a probability distribution over a word
sequence. Self-supervised Learning on a large corpus of data automatically
generates deep learning-based language models. BioBERT and Med-BERT are
language models pre-trained for the healthcare domain. Healthcare uses typical
NLP tasks such as question answering, information extraction, named entity
recognition, and search to simplify and improve processes. However, to ensure
robust application of the results, NLP practitioners need to normalize and
standardize them. One of the main ways of achieving normalization and
standardization is the use of Knowledge Graphs. A Knowledge Graph captures
concepts and their relationships for a specific domain, but their creation is
time-consuming and requires manual intervention from domain experts, which can

Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis of Plastic Surgery Social Media Posts,"  The massive collection of user posts across social media platforms is
primarily untapped for artificial intelligence (AI) use cases based on the

towards plastic surgery based on a tweet or subreddit post with almost 90%
accuracy. Furthermore, the model is capable of achieving higher accuracy on the

"Explaining NonLinear Classification Decisions with Deep Taylor

for various challenging machine learning problems, e.g., image classification,
natural language processing or human action recognition. Although these methods
perform impressively well, they have a significant disadvantage, the lack of
transparency, limiting the interpretability of the solution and thus the scope
of application in practice. Especially DNNs act as black boxes due to their
multilayer nonlinear structure. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology
for interpreting generic multilayer neural networks by decomposing the network
classification decision into contributions of its input elements. Although our
focus is on image classification, the method is applicable to a broad set of

deep Taylor decomposition and efficiently utilizes the structure of the network

Deep Leakage from Gradients,"  Exchanging gradients is a widely used method in modern multi-node machine
learning system (e.g., distributed training, collaborative learning). For a
long time, people believed that gradients are safe to share: i.e., the training
data will not be leaked by gradient exchange. However, we show that it is
possible to obtain the private training data from the publicly shared
gradients. We name this leakage as Deep Leakage from Gradient and empirically
validate the effectiveness on both computer vision and natural language
processing tasks. Experimental results show that our attack is much stronger
than previous approaches: the recovery is pixel-wise accurate for images and
token-wise matching for texts. We want to raise people's awareness to rethink
the gradient's safety. Finally, we discuss several possible strategies to
prevent such deep leakage. The most effective defense method is gradient
pruning.

"Pre-Learning Environment Representations for Data-Efficient Neural
  Instruction Following","  We consider the problem of learning to map from natural language instructions
to state transitions (actions) in a data-efficient manner. Our method takes
inspiration from the idea that it should be easier to ground language to
concepts that have already been formed through pre-linguistic observation. We
augment a baseline instruction-following learner with an initial
environment-learning phase that uses observations of language-free state
transitions to induce a suitable latent representation of actions before
processing the instruction-following training data. We show that mapping to
pre-learned representations substantially improves performance over systems
whose representations are learned from limited instructional data alone.

Investigating Masking-based Data Generation in Language Models,"  The current era of natural language processing (NLP) has been defined by the
prominence of pre-trained language models since the advent of BERT. A feature
of BERT and models with similar architecture is the objective of masked
language modeling, in which part of the input is intentionally masked and the
model is trained to predict this piece of masked information. Data augmentation
is a data-driven technique widely used in machine learning, including research
areas like computer vision and natural language processing, to improve model
performance by artificially augmenting the training data set by designated
techniques. Masked language models (MLM), an essential training feature of
BERT, have introduced a novel approach to perform effective pre-training on
Transformer based models in natural language processing tasks. Recent studies
have utilized masked language model to generate artificially augmented data for
NLP downstream tasks. The experimental results show that Mask based data
augmentation method provides a simple but efficient approach to improve the
model performance. In this paper, we explore and discuss the broader
utilization of these data augmentation methods based on MLM.

A Deep Neural Network Approach To Parallel Sentence Extraction,"  Parallel sentence extraction is a task addressing the data sparsity problem
found in multilingual natural language processing applications. We propose an
end-to-end deep neural network approach to detect translational equivalence
between sentences in two different languages. In contrast to previous
approaches, which typically rely on multiples models and various word alignment
features, by leveraging continuous vector representation of sentences we remove
the need of any domain specific feature engineering. Using a siamese
bidirectional recurrent neural networks, our results against a strong baseline
based on a state-of-the-art parallel sentence extraction system show a
significant improvement in both the quality of the extracted parallel sentences
and the translation performance of statistical machine translation systems. We
believe this study is the first one to investigate deep learning for the
parallel sentence extraction task.

"Detection of Hate Speech using BERT and Hate Speech Word Embedding with
  Deep Model","  The enormous amount of data being generated on the web and social media has
increased the demand for detecting online hate speech. Detecting hate speech
will reduce their negative impact and influence on others. A lot of effort in
the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain aimed to detect hate speech in
general or detect specific hate speech such as religion, race, gender, or
sexual orientation. Hate communities tend to use abbreviations, intentional
spelling mistakes, and coded words in their communication to evade detection,
adding more challenges to hate speech detection tasks. Thus, word
representation will play an increasingly pivotal role in detecting hate speech.
This paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging domain-specific word
embedding in Bidirectional LSTM based deep model to automatically
detect/classify hate speech. Furthermore, we investigate the use of the
transfer learning language model (BERT) on hate speech problem as a binary
classification task. The experiments showed that domainspecific word embedding
with the Bidirectional LSTM based deep model achieved a 93% f1-score while BERT
achieved up to 96% f1-score on a combined balanced dataset from available hate
speech datasets.

"Is Neuro-Symbolic AI Meeting its Promise in Natural Language Processing?
  A Structured Review","  Advocates for Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (NeSy) assert that
combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning will lead to stronger AI than
either paradigm on its own. As successful as deep learning has been, it is
generally accepted that even our best deep learning systems are not very good
at abstract reasoning. And since reasoning is inextricably linked to language,
it makes intuitive sense that Natural Language Processing (NLP), would be a
particularly well-suited candidate for NeSy. We conduct a structured review of
studies implementing NeSy for NLP, with the aim of answering the question of
whether NeSy is indeed meeting its promises: reasoning, out-of-distribution
generalization, interpretability, learning and reasoning from small data, and
transferability to new domains. We examine the impact of knowledge
representation, such as rules and semantic networks, language structure and
relational structure, and whether implicit or explicit reasoning contributes to
higher promise scores. We find that systems where logic is compiled into the
neural network lead to the most NeSy goals being satisfied, while other factors
such as knowledge representation, or type of neural architecture do not exhibit
a clear correlation with goals being met. We find many discrepancies in how
reasoning is defined, specifically in relation to human level reasoning, which
impact decisions about model architectures and drive conclusions which are not
always consistent across studies. Hence we advocate for a more methodical
approach to the application of theories of human reasoning as well as the
development of appropriate benchmarks, which we hope can lead to a better
understanding of progress in the field. We make our data and code available on
github for further analysis.

Joint Learning of Set Cardinality and State Distribution,"  We present a novel approach for learning to predict sets using deep learning.
In recent years, deep neural networks have shown remarkable results in computer
vision, natural language processing and other related problems. Despite their
success, traditional architectures suffer from a serious limitation in that
they are built to deal with structured input and output data, i.e. vectors or
matrices. Many real-world problems, however, are naturally described as sets,
rather than vectors. Existing techniques that allow for sequential data, such
as recurrent neural networks, typically heavily depend on the input and output
order and do not guarantee a valid solution. Here, we derive in a principled
way, a mathematical formulation for set prediction where the output is
permutation invariant. In particular, our approach jointly learns both the
cardinality and the state distribution of the target set. We demonstrate the
validity of our method on the task of multi-label image classification and
achieve a new state of the art on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets.

"Learning to Attack: Towards Textual Adversarial Attacking in Real-world
  Situations","  Adversarial attacking aims to fool deep neural networks with adversarial
examples. In the field of natural language processing, various textual
adversarial attack models have been proposed, varying in the accessibility to
the victim model. Among them, the attack models that only require the output of
the victim model are more fit for real-world situations of adversarial
attacking. However, to achieve high attack performance, these models usually
need to query the victim model too many times, which is neither efficient nor
viable in practice. To tackle this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning
based attack model, which can learn from attack history and launch attacks more
efficiently. In experiments, we evaluate our model by attacking several
state-of-the-art models on the benchmark datasets of multiple tasks including
sentiment analysis, text classification and natural language inference.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently achieves both
better attack performance and higher efficiency than recently proposed baseline
methods. We also find our attack model can bring more robustness improvement to
the victim model by adversarial training. All the code and data of this paper
will be made public.

DeL-haTE: A Deep Learning Tunable Ensemble for Hate Speech Detection,"  Online hate speech on social media has become a fast-growing problem in
recent times. Nefarious groups have developed large content delivery networks
across several main-stream (Twitter and Facebook) and fringe (Gab, 4chan,
8chan, etc.) outlets to deliver cascades of hate messages directed both at
individuals and communities. Thus addressing these issues has become a top
priority for large-scale social media outlets. Three key challenges in
automated detection and classification of hateful content are the lack of
clearly labeled data, evolving vocabulary and lexicon - hashtags, emojis, etc.
- and the lack of baseline models for fringe outlets such as Gab. In this work,
we propose a novel framework with three major contributions. (a) We engineer an
ensemble of deep learning models that combines the strengths of
state-of-the-art approaches, (b) we incorporate a tuning factor into this
framework that leverages transfer learning to conduct automated hate speech
classification on unlabeled datasets, like Gab, and (c) we develop a weak
supervised learning methodology that allows our framework to train on unlabeled
data. Our ensemble models achieve an 83% hate recall on the HON dataset,
surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art deep models. We demonstrate
that weak supervised training in combination with classifier tuning
significantly increases model performance on unlabeled data from Gab, achieving
a hate recall of 67%.

"Analyzing the Generalizability of Deep Contextualized Language
  Representations For Text Classification","  This study evaluates the robustness of two state-of-the-art deep contextual
language representations, ELMo and DistilBERT, on supervised learning of binary
protest news classification and sentiment analysis of product reviews. A
""cross-context"" setting is enabled using test sets that are distinct from the
training data. Specifically, in the news classification task, the models are
developed on local news from India and tested on the local news from China. In
the sentiment analysis task, the models are trained on movie reviews and tested
on customer reviews. This comparison is aimed at exploring the limits of the
representative power of today's Natural Language Processing systems on the path
to the systems that are generalizable to real-life scenarios. The models are
fine-tuned and fed into a Feed-Forward Neural Network and a Bidirectional Long
Short Term Memory network. Multinomial Naive Bayes and Linear Support Vector
Machine are used as traditional baselines. The results show that, in binary
text classification, DistilBERT is significantly better than ELMo on
generalizing to the cross-context setting. ELMo is observed to be significantly
more robust to the cross-context test data than both baselines. On the other
hand, the baselines performed comparably well to ELMo when the training and
test data are subsets of the same corpus (no cross-context). DistilBERT is also
found to be 30% smaller and 83% faster than ELMo. The results suggest that
DistilBERT can transfer generic semantic knowledge to other domains better than
ELMo. DistilBERT is also favorable in incorporating into real-life systems for
it requires a smaller computational training budget. When generalization is not
the utmost preference and test domain is similar to the training domain, the
traditional ML algorithms can still be considered as more economic alternatives
to deep language representations.

Deep Human Answer Understanding for Natural Reverse QA,"  This study focuses on a reverse question answering (QA) procedure, in which
machines proactively raise questions and humans supply the answers. This
procedure exists in many real human-machine interaction applications. However,
a crucial problem in human-machine interaction is answer understanding. The
existing solutions have relied on mandatory option term selection to avoid
automatic answer understanding. However, these solutions have led to unnatural

end, the current study proposes a novel deep answer understanding network,
called AntNet, for reverse QA. The network consists of three new modules,
namely, skeleton attention for questions, relevance-aware representation of
answers, and multi-hop based fusion. As answer understanding for reverse QA has
not been explored, a new data corpus is compiled in this study. Experimental
results indicate that our proposed network is significantly better than
existing methods and those modified from classical natural language processing
deep models. The effectiveness of the three new modules is also verified.

Semantic Representation and Inference for NLP,"  Semantic representation and inference is essential for Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The state of the art for semantic representation and
inference is deep learning, and particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer Self-Attention models.
This thesis investigates the use of deep learning for novel semantic
representation and inference, and makes contributions in the following three
areas: creating training data, improving semantic representations and extending
inference learning. In terms of creating training data, we contribute the
largest publicly available dataset of real-life factual claims for the purpose
of automatic claim verification (MultiFC), and we present a novel inference
model composed of multi-scale CNNs with different kernel sizes that learn from
external sources to infer fact checking labels. In terms of improving semantic
representations, we contribute a novel model that captures non-compositional
semantic indicators. By definition, the meaning of a non-compositional phrase
cannot be inferred from the individual meanings of its composing words (e.g.,
hot dog). Motivated by this, we operationalize the compositionality of a phrase
contextually by enriching the phrase representation with external word
embeddings and knowledge graphs. Finally, in terms of inference learning, we
propose a series of novel deep learning architectures that improve inference by
using syntactic dependencies, by ensembling role guided attention heads,
incorporating gating layers, and concatenating multiple heads in novel and
effective ways. This thesis consists of seven publications (five published and
two under review).

concern is the use of ML algorithms in cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as

consequences. However, existing approaches to generating adversarial examples
and devising robust ML algorithms mostly ignore the semantics and context of
the overall system containing the ML component. For example, in an autonomous
vehicle using deep learning for perception, not every adversarial example for
the neural network might lead to a harmful consequence. Moreover, one may want
to prioritize the search for adversarial examples towards those that
significantly modify the desired semantics of the overall system. Along the
same lines, existing algorithms for constructing robust ML algorithms ignore
the specification of the overall system. In this paper, we argue that the
semantics and specification of the overall system has a crucial role to play in
this line of research. We present preliminary research results that support
this claim.

Improving Transparency of Deep Neural Inference Process,"  Deep learning techniques are rapidly advanced recently, and becoming a
necessity component for widespread systems. However, the inference process of
deep learning is black-box, and not very suitable to safety-critical systems
which must exhibit high transparency. In this paper, to address this black-box
limitation, we develop a simple analysis method which consists of 1) structural
feature analysis: lists of the features contributing to inference process, 2)
linguistic feature analysis: lists of the natural language labels describing
the visual attributes for each feature contributing to inference process, and
3) consistency analysis: measuring consistency among input data, inference
(label), and the result of our structural and linguistic feature analysis. Our
analysis is simplified to reflect the actual inference process for high
transparency, whereas it does not include any additional black-box mechanisms
such as LSTM for highly human readable results. We conduct experiments and
discuss the results of our analysis qualitatively and quantitatively, and come
to believe that our work improves the transparency of neural networks.
Evaluated through 12,800 human tasks, 75% workers answer that input data and
result of our feature analysis are consistent, and 70% workers answer that
inference (label) and result of our feature analysis are consistent. In
addition to the evaluation of the proposed analysis, we find that our analysis
also provide suggestions, or possible next actions such as expanding neural
network complexity or collecting training data to improve a neural network.

"Mixture of Expert/Imitator Networks: Scalable Semi-supervised Learning
  Framework","  The current success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in an increasingly broad
range of tasks involving artificial intelligence strongly depends on the
quality and quantity of labeled training data. In general, the scarcity of
labeled data, which is often observed in many natural language processing
tasks, is one of the most important issues to be addressed. Semi-supervised
learning (SSL) is a promising approach to overcoming this issue by
incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a
novel scalable method of SSL for text classification tasks. The unique property
of our method, Mixture of Expert/Imitator Networks, is that imitator networks
learn to ""imitate"" the estimated label distribution of the expert network over
the unlabeled data, which potentially contributes a set of features for the
classification. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently improves the performance of several types of baseline DNNs. We
also demonstrate that our method has the more data, better performance property
with promising scalability to the amount of unlabeled data.

BIM: Block-Wise Self-Supervised Learning with Masked Image Modeling,"  Like masked language modeling (MLM) in natural language processing, masked
image modeling (MIM) aims to extract valuable insights from image patches to
enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the underlying deep neural
network (DNN). Contrasted with other training paradigms like supervised
learning and unsupervised contrastive learning, masked image modeling (MIM)
pretraining typically demands significant computational resources in order to
manage large training data batches (e.g., 4096). The significant memory and
computation requirements pose a considerable challenge to its broad adoption.
To mitigate this, we introduce a novel learning framework,
termed~\textit{Block-Wise Masked Image Modeling} (BIM). This framework involves
decomposing the MIM tasks into several sub-tasks with independent computation
patterns, resulting in block-wise back-propagation operations instead of the
traditional end-to-end approach. Our proposed BIM maintains superior
performance compared to conventional MIM while greatly reducing peak memory
consumption. Moreover, BIM naturally enables the concurrent training of
numerous DNN backbones of varying depths. This leads to the creation of
multiple trained DNN backbones, each tailored to different hardware platforms
with distinct computing capabilities. This approach significantly reduces
computational costs in comparison with training each DNN backbone individually.
Our framework offers a promising solution for resource constrained training of
MIM.

SINGA-Easy: An Easy-to-Use Framework for MultiModal Analysis,"  Deep learning has achieved great success in a wide spectrum of multimedia
applications such as image classification, natural language processing and
multimodal data analysis. Recent years have seen the development of many deep
learning frameworks that provide a high-level programming interface for users
to design models, conduct training and deploy inference. However, it remains
challenging to build an efficient end-to-end multimedia application with most
existing frameworks. Specifically, in terms of usability, it is demanding for
non-experts to implement deep learning models, obtain the right settings for
the entire machine learning pipeline, manage models and datasets, and exploit
external data sources all together. Further, in terms of adaptability, elastic
computation solutions are much needed as the actual serving workload fluctuates
constantly, and scaling the hardware resources to handle the fluctuating
workload is typically infeasible. To address these challenges, we introduce
SINGA-Easy, a new deep learning framework that provides distributed
hyper-parameter tuning at the training stage, dynamic computational cost
control at the inference stage, and intuitive user interactions with multimedia
contents facilitated by model explanation. Our experiments on the training and
deployment of multi-modality data analysis applications show that the framework
is both usable and adaptable to dynamic inference loads. We implement
SINGA-Easy on top of Apache SINGA and demonstrate our system with the entire
machine learning life cycle.

An overview of deep learning in medical imaging focusing on MRI,"  What has happened in machine learning lately, and what does it mean for the
future of medical image analysis? Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous
amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around
2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other
established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks
are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas,
from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in
academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical
imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare
in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent
advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical
image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast
expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but
put particular focus on deep learning in MRI.
  Our aim is threefold: (i) give a brief introduction to deep learning with
pointers to core references; (ii) indicate how deep learning has been applied
to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from
segmentation to disease prediction; (iii) provide a starting point for people
interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of machine
learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources,
state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems
related medical imaging.

"Neural Natural Language Processing for Unstructured Data in Electronic

events and observations, are ubiquitous in medicine and critical to healthcare
delivery, operations, and research. Despite this central role, EHRs are
notoriously difficult to process automatically. Well over half of the
information stored within EHRs is in the form of unstructured text (e.g.
provider notes, operation reports) and remains largely untapped for secondary
use. Recently, however, newer neural network and deep learning approaches to
Natural Language Processing (NLP) have made considerable advances,
outperforming traditional statistical and rule-based systems on a variety of
tasks. In this survey paper, we summarize current neural NLP methods for EHR

question answering, phenotyping, knowledge graphs, medical dialogue,
multilinguality, interpretability, etc.

"The value of text for small business default prediction: A deep learning
  approach","  Compared to consumer lending, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (mSME)
credit risk modelling is particularly challenging, as, often, the same sources
of information are not available. Therefore, it is standard policy for a loan
officer to provide a textual loan assessment to mitigate limited data
availability. In turn, this statement is analysed by a credit expert alongside
any available standard credit data. In our paper, we exploit recent advances
from the field of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP),
including the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
model, to extract information from 60 000 textual assessments provided by a
lender. We consider the performance in terms of the AUC (Area Under the
receiver operating characteristic Curve) and Brier Score metrics and find that
the text alone is surprisingly effective for predicting default. However, when
combined with traditional data, it yields no additional predictive capability,
with performance dependent on the text's length. Our proposed deep learning
model does, however, appear to be robust to the quality of the text and
therefore suitable for partly automating the mSME lending process. We also
demonstrate how the content of loan assessments influences performance, leading
us to a series of recommendations on a new strategy for collecting future mSME
loan assessments.

"Deep Active Learning for Sequence Labeling Based on Diversity and
  Uncertainty in Gradient","  Recently, several studies have investigated active learning (AL) for natural
language processing tasks to alleviate data dependency. However, for query
selection, most of these studies mainly rely on uncertainty-based sampling,
which generally does not exploit the structural information of the unlabeled
data. This leads to a sampling bias in the batch active learning setting, which
selects several samples at once. In this work, we demonstrate that the amount
of labeled training data can be reduced using active learning when it
incorporates both uncertainty and diversity in the sequence labeling task. We
examined the effects of our sequence-based approach by selecting weighted
diverse in the gradient embedding approach across multiple tasks, datasets,
models, and consistently outperform classic uncertainty-based sampling and
diversity-based sampling.

Neurosymbolic AI for Situated Language Understanding,"  In recent years, data-intensive AI, particularly the domain of natural
language processing and understanding, has seen significant progress driven by
the advent of large datasets and deep neural networks that have sidelined more
classic AI approaches to the field. These systems can apparently demonstrate
sophisticated linguistic understanding or generation capabilities, but often
fail to transfer their skills to situations they have not encountered before.
We argue that computational situated grounding provides a solution to some of
these learning challenges by creating situational representations that both
serve as a formal model of the salient phenomena, and contain rich amounts of
exploitable, task-appropriate data for training new, flexible computational
models. Our model reincorporates some ideas of classic AI into a framework of
neurosymbolic intelligence, using multimodal contextual modeling of interactive
situations, events, and object properties. We discuss how situated grounding
provides diverse data and multiple levels of modeling for a variety of AI
learning challenges, including learning how to interact with object
affordances, learning semantics for novel structures and configurations, and
transferring such learned knowledge to new objects and situations.

"Fair Differentiable Neural Network Architecture Search for Long-Tailed
  Data with Self-Supervised Learning","  Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have positioned deep
learning (DL) as a pivotal technology in fields like computer vision, data
mining, and natural language processing. A critical factor in DL performance is
the selection of neural network architecture. Traditional predefined
architectures often fail to adapt to different data distributions, making it
challenging to achieve optimal performance. Neural architecture search (NAS)
offers a solution by automatically designing architectures tailored to specific
datasets. However, the effectiveness of NAS diminishes on long-tailed datasets,
where a few classes have abundant samples, and many have few, leading to biased
models.In this paper, we explore to improve the searching and training
performance of NAS on long-tailed datasets. Specifically, we first discuss the
related works about NAS and the deep learning method for long-tailed
datasets.Then, we focus on an existing work, called SSF-NAS, which integrates
the self-supervised learning and fair differentiable NAS to making NAS achieve
better performance on long-tailed datasets.An detailed description about the
fundamental techniques for SSF-NAS is provided in this paper, including DARTS,
FairDARTS, and Barlow Twins. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments on
the CIFAR10-LT dataset for performance evaluation, where the results are align

"Causality Extraction from Nuclear Licensee Event Reports Using a Hybrid

parallels with the objects-first and objects-later debate in CS1 education. We
observe that teaching classical approaches adds value to student learning by
building an intuitive understanding of NLP problems, potential solutions, and
even deep learning models themselves. Despite classical approaches not being

Deep Latent Defence,"  Deep learning methods have shown state of the art performance in a range of
tasks from computer vision to natural language processing. However, it is well
known that such systems are vulnerable to attackers who craft inputs in order
to cause misclassification. The level of perturbation an attacker needs to
introduce in order to cause such a misclassification can be extremely small,
and often imperceptible. This is of significant security concern, particularly
where misclassification can cause harm to humans.
  We thus propose Deep Latent Defence, an architecture which seeks to combine
adversarial training with a detection system. At its core Deep Latent Defence
has a adversarially trained neural network. A series of encoders take the
intermediate layer representation of data as it passes though the network and
project it to a latent space which we use for detecting adversarial samples via
a $k$-nn classifier. We present results using both grey and white box
attackers, as well as an adaptive $L_{\infty}$ bounded attack which was
constructed specifically to try and evade our defence. We find that even under
the strongest attacker model that we have investigated our defence is able to
offer significant defensive benefits.

A Survey on Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning,"  Large deep learning models are impressive, but they struggle when real-time

easily leads to catastrophic forgetting and overfitting problems, severely

limitations on data volume and acquisition time, while improving practicality

This agent's key challenge is to accurately comprehend the user's prediction
goals and, consequently, formulate precise ML tasks, adjust data sets and model
parameters accordingly, and articulate results effectively. In this paper, we

  Question Answering","  When answering a question, humans utilize the information available across
different modalities to synthesize a consistent and complete chain of thought
(CoT). This process is normally a black box in the case of deep learning models
like large-scale language models. Recently, science question benchmarks have
been used to diagnose the multi-hop reasoning ability and interpretability of
an AI system. However, existing datasets fail to provide annotations for the
answers, or are restricted to the textual-only modality, small scales, and
limited domain diversity. To this end, we present Science Question Answering
(ScienceQA), a new benchmark that consists of ~21k multimodal multiple choice
questions with a diverse set of science topics and annotations of their answers
with corresponding lectures and explanations. We further design language models
to learn to generate lectures and explanations as the chain of thought (CoT) to
mimic the multi-hop reasoning process when answering ScienceQA questions.
ScienceQA demonstrates the utility of CoT in language models, as CoT improves
the question answering performance by 1.20% in few-shot GPT-3 and 3.99% in
fine-tuned UnifiedQA. We also explore the upper bound for models to leverage
explanations by feeding those in the input; we observe that it improves the
few-shot performance of GPT-3 by 18.96%. Our analysis further shows that
language models, similar to humans, benefit from explanations to learn from
fewer data and achieve the same performance with just 40% of the data. The data
and code are available at https://scienceqa.github.io.

"Autonomous development and learning in artificial intelligence and
  robotics: Scaling up deep learning to human--like learning","  Autonomous lifelong development and learning is a fundamental capability of
humans, differentiating them from current deep learning systems. However, other
branches of artificial intelligence have designed crucial ingredients towards
autonomous learning: curiosity and intrinsic motivation, social learning and
natural interaction with peers, and embodiment. These mechanisms guide
exploration and autonomous choice of goals, and integrating them with deep
learning opens stimulating perspectives. Deep learning (DL) approaches made
great advances in artificial intelligence, but are still far away from human
learning. As argued convincingly by Lake et al., differences include human
capabilities to learn causal models of the world from very little data,
leveraging compositional representations and priors like intuitive physics and
psychology. However, there are other fundamental differences between current DL
systems and human learning, as well as technical ingredients to fill this gap,
that are either superficially, or not adequately, discussed by Lake et al.
These fundamental mechanisms relate to autonomous development and learning.
They are bound to play a central role in artificial intelligence in the future.
Current DL systems require engineers to manually specify a task-specific
objective function for every new task, and learn through off-line processing of
large training databases. On the contrary, humans learn autonomously open-ended
repertoires of skills, deciding for themselves which goals to pursue or value,
and which skills to explore, driven by intrinsic motivation/curiosity and
social learning through natural interaction with peers. Such learning processes
are incremental, online, and progressive. Human child development involves a
progressive increase of complexity in a curriculum of learning where skills are
explored, acquired, and built on each other, through particular ordering and
timing. Finally, human learning happens in the physical world, and through
bodily and physical experimentation, under severe constraints on energy, time,
and computational resources. In the two last decades, the field of
Developmental and Cognitive Robotics (Cangelosi and Schlesinger, 2015, Asada et
al., 2009), in strong interaction with developmental psychology and
neuroscience, has achieved significant advances in computational

"Few-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer for Prompting Large Language Models in
  Low-Resource Languages","  Large pre-trained language models (PLMs) are at the forefront of advances in
Natural Language Processing. One widespread use case of PLMs is ""prompting"" -
or in-context learning - where a user provides a description of a task and some
completed examples of the task to a PLM as context before prompting the PLM to
perform the task on a new example. Only the largest, most capable PLMs are able
to perform in-context learning effectively, and these models are typically
trained with a predominantly English corpus, leaving all other languages
behind. The data limitations in most languages preclude the training of
language-specific PLMs capable of prompting. Albeit the surge in work of
prompting settings, it is still unclear how PLMs should be adapted
cross-lingually specifically for prompting. We evaluate the possible methods to
adapt LLaMa, a 7B parameter open-source PLM mainly trained in English, for
prompting in low-resource languages, namely for Kinyarwanda, Hausa, and
Luganda. We consider three methods: few-shot prompting (prompt),
language-adaptive fine-tuning (LAFT), and neural machine translation
(translate), and evaluate on abstractive summarization, multi-class topic
classification, and named-entity recognition. Although LAFT carries the
greatest compute cost and intuitively should lead to the best results, our
experiments exhibit that LAFT is only occasionally the optimal choice for
adapting PLMs for prompting. Rather, the translate and prompt settings are a
compute-efficient and cost-effective method of few-shot prompting for the
selected low-resource languages. We find that the results are task and language
dependent but find that the prompting method is the best on average across all
tasks and languages. Results show that the prompt setting performs better than
both translating and LAFT with statistical significance for all shots when
aggregated across all tasks and languages.

"Digestion Algorithm in Hierarchical Symbolic Forests: A Fast Text
  Normalization Algorithm and Semantic Parsing Framework for Specific Scenarios
  and Lightweight Deployment","  Text Normalization and Semantic Parsing have numerous applications in natural
language processing, such as natural language programming, paraphrasing, data
augmentation, constructing expert systems, text matching, and more. Despite the
prominent achievements of deep learning in Large Language Models (LLMs), the
interpretability of neural network architectures is still poor, which affects
their credibility and hence limits the deployments of risk-sensitive scenarios.
In certain scenario-specific domains with scarce data, rapidly obtaining a
large number of supervised learning labels is challenging, and the workload of
manually labeling data would be enormous. Catastrophic forgetting in neural
networks further leads to low data utilization rates. In situations where swift
responses are vital, the density of the model makes local deployment difficult
and the response time long, which is not conducive to local applications of
these fields. Inspired by the multiplication rule, a principle of combinatorial
mathematics, and human thinking patterns, a multilayer framework along with its
algorithm, the Digestion Algorithm in Hierarchical Symbolic Forests (DAHSF), is
proposed to address these above issues, combining text normalization and
semantic parsing workflows. The Chinese Scripting Language ""Fire Bunny
Intelligent Development Platform V2.0"" is an important test and application of
the technology discussed in this paper. DAHSF can run locally in
scenario-specific domains on little datasets, with model size and memory usage
optimized by at least two orders of magnitude, thus improving the execution
speed, and possessing a promising optimization outlook.

important aspects of the generated text including its diversity and fluency.

that the quality of generations improves to a peak at approximately three times

"One Single Deep Bidirectional LSTM Network for Word Sense Disambiguation
  of Text Data","  Due to recent technical and scientific advances, we have a wealth of
information hidden in unstructured text data such as offline/online narratives,
research articles, and clinical reports. To mine these data properly,
attributable to their innate ambiguity, a Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
algorithm can avoid numbers of difficulties in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) pipeline. However, considering a large number of ambiguous words in one
language or technical domain, we may encounter limiting constraints for proper
deployment of existing WSD models. This paper attempts to address the problem
of one-classifier-per-one-word WSD algorithms by proposing a single
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) network which by considering
senses and context sequences works on all ambiguous words collectively.
Evaluated on SensEval-3 benchmark, we show the result of our model is
comparable with top-performing WSD algorithms. We also discuss how applying
additional modifications alleviates the model fault and the need for more
training data.

A Comprehensive Review on Summarizing Financial News Using Deep Learning,"  Investors make investment decisions depending on several factors such as
fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and quantitative analysis. Another
factor on which investors can make investment decisions is through sentiment
analysis of news headlines, the sole purpose of this study. Natural Language
Processing techniques are typically used to deal with such a large amount of
data and get valuable information out of it. NLP algorithms convert raw text
into numerical representations that machines can easily understand and
interpret. This conversion can be done using various embedding techniques. In
this research, embedding techniques used are BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT,
GloVe, and FastText, and then fed to deep learning models such as RNN and LSTM.
This work aims to evaluate these model's performance to choose the robust model
in identifying the significant factors influencing the prediction. During this
research, it was expected that Deep Leaming would be applied to get the desired
results or achieve better accuracy than the state-of-the-art. The models are

"Feature-rich multiplex lexical networks reveal mental strategies of
  early language learning","  Knowledge in the human mind exhibits a dualistic vector/network nature.
Modelling words as vectors is key to natural language processing, whereas
networks of word associations can map the nature of semantic memory. We
reconcile these paradigms - fragmented across linguistics, psychology and
computer science - by introducing FEature-Rich MUltiplex LEXical (FERMULEX)
networks. This novel framework merges structural similarities in networks and
vector features of words, which can be combined or explored independently.
Similarities model heterogenous word associations across
semantic/syntactic/phonological aspects of knowledge. Words are enriched with
multi-dimensional feature embeddings including frequency, age of acquisition,
length and polysemy. These aspects enable unprecedented explorations of
cognitive knowledge. Through CHILDES data, we use FERMULEX networks to model
normative language acquisition by 1000 toddlers between 18 and 30 months.
Similarities and embeddings capture word homophily via conformity, which
measures assortative mixing via distance and features. Conformity unearths a
language kernel of frequent/polysemous/short nouns and verbs key for basic
sentence production, supporting recent evidence of children's syntactic
constructs emerging at 30 months. This kernel is invisible to network
core-detection and feature-only clustering: It emerges from the dual
vector/network nature of words. Our quantitative analysis reveals two key
strategies in early word learning. Modelling word acquisition as random walks
on FERMULEX topology, we highlight non-uniform filling of communicative
developmental inventories (CDIs). Conformity-based walkers lead to accurate
(75%), precise (55%) and partially well-recalled (34%) predictions of early
word learning in CDIs, providing quantitative support to previous empirical
findings and developmental theories.

"Complex-Valued Neural Networks for Data-Driven Signal Processing and
  Signal Understanding","  Complex-valued neural networks have emerged boasting superior modeling
performance for many tasks across the signal processing, sensing, and
communications arenas. However, developing complex-valued models currently
demands development of basic deep learning operations, such as linear or
convolution layers, as modern deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Tensor
flow do not adequately support complex-valued neural networks. This paper
overviews a package built on PyTorch with the intention of implementing
light-weight interfaces for common complex-valued neural network operations and
architectures. Similar to natural language understanding (NLU), which as
recently made tremendous leaps towards text-based intelligence, RF Signal
Understanding (RFSU) is a promising field extending conventional signal
processing algorithms using a hybrid approach of signal mechanics-based insight
with data-driven modeling power. Notably, we include efficient implementations
for linear, convolution, and attention modules in addition to activation
functions and normalization layers such as batchnorm and layernorm.
Additionally, we include efficient implementations of manifold-based
complex-valued neural network layers that have shown tremendous promise but
remain relatively unexplored in many research contexts. Although there is an
emphasis on 1-D data tensors, due to a focus on signal processing,
communications, and radar data, many of the routines are implemented for 2-D
and 3-D data as well. Specifically, the proposed approach offers a useful set
of tools and documentation for data-driven signal processing research and
practical implementation.

"An ensemble deep learning technique for detecting suicidal ideation from
  posts in social media platforms","  Suicidal ideation detection from social media is an evolving research with
great challenges. Many of the people who have the tendency to suicide share
their thoughts and opinions through social media platforms. As part of many
researches it is observed that the publicly available posts from social media
contain valuable criteria to effectively detect individuals with suicidal
thoughts. The most difficult part to prevent suicide is to detect and
understand the complex risk factors and warning signs that may lead to suicide.
This can be achieved by identifying the sudden changes in a user behavior
automatically. Natural language processing techniques can be used to collect
behavioral and textual features from social media interactions and these
features can be passed to a specially designed framework to detect anomalies in
human interactions that are indicators of suicidal intentions. We can achieve
fast detection of suicidal ideation using deep learning and/or machine learning
based classification approaches. For such a purpose, we can employ the
combination of LSTM and CNN models to detect such emotions from posts of the
users. In order to improve the accuracy, some approaches like using more data
for training, using attention model to improve the efficiency of existing
models etc. could be done. This paper proposes a LSTM-Attention-CNN combined
model to analyze social media submissions to detect any underlying suicidal
intentions. During evaluations, the proposed model demonstrated an accuracy of
90.3 percent and an F1-score of 92.6 percent, which is greater than the
baseline models.

"One Model to Rule them all: Multitask and Multilingual Modelling for
  Lexical Analysis","  When learning a new skill, you take advantage of your preexisting skills and
knowledge. For instance, if you are a skilled violinist, you will likely have
an easier time learning to play cello. Similarly, when learning a new language
you take advantage of the languages you already speak. For instance, if your
native language is Norwegian and you decide to learn Dutch, the lexical overlap
between these two languages will likely benefit your rate of language
acquisition. This thesis deals with the intersection of learning multiple tasks
and learning multiple languages in the context of Natural Language Processing
(NLP), which can be defined as the study of computational processing of human
language. Although these two types of learning may seem different on the
surface, we will see that they share many similarities.
  The traditional approach in NLP is to consider a single task for a single
language at a time. However, recent advances allow for broadening this
approach, by considering data for multiple tasks and languages simultaneously.
This is an important approach to explore further as the key to improving the
reliability of NLP, especially for low-resource languages, is to take advantage
of all relevant data whenever possible. In doing so, the hope is that in the
long term, low-resource languages can benefit from the advances made in NLP
which are currently to a large extent reserved for high-resource languages.
This, in turn, may then have positive consequences for, e.g., language
preservation, as speakers of minority languages will have a lower degree of
pressure to using high-resource languages. In the short term, answering the
specific research questions posed should be of use to NLP researchers working
towards the same goal.

"Aquila: A Hierarchically Aligned Visual-Language Model for Enhanced

in visual language capabilities through visual instruction tuning, showing
great promise in the field of remote sensing image interpretation. However,
existing remote sensing vision language models (RSVLMs) often fall short in
capturing the complex characteristics of remote sensing scenes, as they
typically rely on low resolution, single scale visual features and simplistic
methods to map visual features to language features. In this paper, we present

and multi scale input, and enhancing feature alignment significantly improve

effectiveness of Aquila through extensive quantitative experiments and

"Deep Generative Modeling-based Data Augmentation with Demonstration
  using the BFBT Benchmark Void Fraction Datasets","  Deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable successes in many disciplines such
as computer vision and natural language processing due to the availability of
``big data''. However, such success cannot be easily replicated in many nuclear
engineering problems because of the limited amount of training data, especially
when the data comes from high-cost experiments. To overcome such a data
scarcity issue, this paper explores the applications of deep generative models

comparable generative performance with similar errors in the synthetic data,
with CVAEs achieving the smallest errors. The findings shows that DGMs have a
great potential to augment scientific data in nuclear engineering, which proves
effective for expanding the training dataset and enabling other DL models to be

DeepSI: Interactive Deep Learning for Semantic Interaction,"  In this paper, we design novel interactive deep learning methods to improve
semantic interactions in visual analytics applications. The ability of semantic
interaction to infer analysts' precise intents during sensemaking is dependent
on the quality of the underlying data representation. We propose the
$\text{DeepSI}_{\text{finetune}}$ framework that integrates deep learning into
the human-in-the-loop interactive sensemaking pipeline, with two important
properties. First, deep learning extracts meaningful representations from raw
data, which improves semantic interaction inference. Second, semantic
interactions are exploited to fine-tune the deep learning representations,
which then further improves semantic interaction inference. This feedback loop
between human interaction and deep learning enables efficient learning of user-
and task-specific representations. To evaluate the advantage of embedding the
deep learning within the semantic interaction loop, we compare
$\text{DeepSI}_{\text{finetune}}$ against a state-of-the-art but more basic use
of deep learning as only a feature extractor pre-processed outside of the
interactive loop. Results of two complementary studies, a human-centered
qualitative case study and an algorithm-centered simulation-based quantitative
experiment, show that $\text{DeepSI}_{\text{finetune}}$ more accurately

A Survey on Extraction of Causal Relations from Natural Language Text,"  As an essential component of human cognition, cause-effect relations appear
frequently in text, and curating cause-effect relations from text helps in
building causal networks for predictive tasks. Existing causality extraction
techniques include knowledge-based, statistical machine learning(ML)-based, and
deep learning-based approaches. Each method has its advantages and weaknesses.
For example, knowledge-based methods are understandable but require extensive
manual domain knowledge and have poor cross-domain applicability. Statistical
machine learning methods are more automated because of natural language
processing (NLP) toolkits. However, feature engineering is labor-intensive, and
toolkits may lead to error propagation. In the past few years, deep learning
techniques attract substantial attention from NLP researchers because of its'
powerful representation learning ability and the rapid increase in
computational resources. Their limitations include high computational costs and
a lack of adequate annotated training data. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive survey of causality extraction. We initially introduce primary
forms existing in the causality extraction: explicit intra-sentential
causality, implicit causality, and inter-sentential causality. Next, we list
benchmark datasets and modeling assessment methods for causal relation
extraction. Then, we present a structured overview of the three techniques with

"Where's the Question? A Multi-channel Deep Convolutional Neural Network
  for Question Identification in Textual Data","  In most clinical practice settings, there is no rigorous reviewing of the
clinical documentation, resulting in inaccurate information captured in the
patient medical records. The gold standard in clinical data capturing is
achieved via ""expert-review"", where clinicians can have a dialogue with a
domain expert (reviewers) and ask them questions about data entry rules.
Automatically identifying ""real questions"" in these dialogues could uncover
ambiguities or common problems in data capturing in a given clinical setting.
  In this study, we proposed a novel multi-channel deep convolutional neural
network architecture, namely Quest-CNN, for the purpose of separating real
questions that expect an answer (information or help) about an issue from
sentences that are not questions, as well as from questions referring to an
issue mentioned in a nearby sentence (e.g., can you clarify this?), which we
will refer as ""c-questions"". We conducted a comprehensive performance
comparison analysis of the proposed multi-channel deep convolutional neural
network against other deep neural networks. Furthermore, we evaluated the
performance of traditional rule-based and learning-based methods for detecting
question sentences. The proposed Quest-CNN achieved the best F1 score both on a
dataset of data entry-review dialogue in a dialysis care setting, and on a
general domain dataset.

"HEIDL: Learning Linguistic Expressions with Deep Learning and
  Human-in-the-Loop","  While the role of humans is increasingly recognized in machine learning
community, representation of and interaction with models in current
human-in-the-loop machine learning (HITL-ML) approaches are too low-level and
far-removed from human's conceptual models. We demonstrate HEIDL, a prototype
HITL-ML system that exposes the machine-learned model through high-level,
explainable linguistic expressions formed of predicates representing semantic
structure of text. In HEIDL, human's role is elevated from simply evaluating
model predictions to interpreting and even updating the model logic directly by
enabling interaction with rule predicates themselves. Raising the currency of
interaction to such semantic levels calls for new interaction paradigms between
humans and machines that result in improved productivity for text analytics
model development process. Moreover, by involving humans in the process, the
human-machine co-created models generalize better to unseen data as domain
experts are able to instill their expertise by extrapolating from what has been
learned by automated algorithms from few labelled data.

Lexical semantics enhanced neural word embeddings,"  Current breakthroughs in natural language processing have benefited
dramatically from neural language models, through which distributional
semantics can leverage neural data representations to facilitate downstream
applications. Since neural embeddings use context prediction on word
co-occurrences to yield dense vectors, they are inevitably prone to capture
more semantic association than semantic similarity. To improve vector space
models in deriving semantic similarity, we post-process neural word embeddings
through deep metric learning, through which we can inject lexical-semantic
relations, including syn/antonymy and hypo/hypernymy, into a distributional
space. We introduce hierarchy-fitting, a novel semantic specialization approach
to modelling semantic similarity nuances inherently stored in the IS-A
hierarchies. Hierarchy-fitting attains state-of-the-art results on the common-
and rare-word benchmark datasets for deriving semantic similarity from neural
word embeddings. It also incorporates an asymmetric distance function to
specialize hypernymy's directionality explicitly, through which it
significantly improves vanilla embeddings in multiple evaluation tasks of
detecting hypernymy and directionality without negative impacts on semantic
similarity judgement. The results demonstrate the efficacy of hierarchy-fitting
in specializing neural embeddings with semantic relations in late fusion,
potentially expanding its applicability to aggregating heterogeneous data and
various knowledge resources for learning multimodal semantic spaces.

"Unsupervised Cross-Domain Prerequisite Chain Learning using Variational
  Graph Autoencoders","  Learning prerequisite chains is an essential task for efficiently acquiring
knowledge in both known and unknown domains. For example, one may be an expert
in the natural language processing (NLP) domain but want to determine the best
order to learn new concepts in an unfamiliar Computer Vision domain (CV). Both
domains share some common concepts, such as machine learning basics and deep
learning models. In this paper, we propose unsupervised cross-domain concept
prerequisite chain learning using an optimized variational graph autoencoder.
Our model learns to transfer concept prerequisite relations from an
information-rich domain (source domain) to an information-poor domain (target
domain), substantially surpassing other baseline models. Also, we expand an

Curriculum Learning with Adam: The Devil Is in the Wrong Details,"  Curriculum learning (CL) posits that machine learning models -- similar to
humans -- may learn more efficiently from data that match their current
learning progress. However, CL methods are still poorly understood and, in
particular for natural language processing (NLP), have achieved only limited
success. In this paper, we explore why. Starting from an attempt to replicate
and extend a number of recent curriculum methods, we find that their results
are surprisingly brittle when applied to NLP. A deep dive into the
(in)effectiveness of the curricula in some scenarios shows us why: when
curricula are employed in combination with the popular Adam optimisation
algorithm, they oftentimes learn to adapt to suboptimally chosen optimisation
parameters for this algorithm. We present a number of different case studies
with different common hand-crafted and automated CL approaches to illustrate
this phenomenon, and we find that none of them outperforms optimisation with
only Adam with well-chosen hyperparameters. As such, our results contribute to
understanding why CL methods work, but at the same time urge caution when
claiming positive results.

"Breaking Language Barriers: A Question Answering Dataset for Hindi and
  Marathi","  The recent advances in deep-learning have led to the development of highly
sophisticated systems with an unquenchable appetite for data. On the other
hand, building good deep-learning models for low-resource languages remains a
challenging task. This paper focuses on developing a Question Answering dataset
for two such languages- Hindi and Marathi. Despite Hindi being the 3rd most
spoken language worldwide, with 345 million speakers, and Marathi being the
11th most spoken language globally, with 83.2 million speakers, both languages
face limited resources for building efficient Question Answering systems. To
tackle the challenge of data scarcity, we have developed a novel approach for
translating the SQuAD 2.0 dataset into Hindi and Marathi. We release the
largest Question-Answering dataset available for these languages, with each
dataset containing 28,000 samples. We evaluate the dataset on various
architectures and release the best-performing models for both Hindi and
Marathi, which will facilitate further research in these languages. Leveraging
similarity tools, our method holds the potential to create datasets in diverse
languages, thereby enhancing the understanding of natural language across
varied linguistic contexts. Our fine-tuned models, code, and dataset will be
made publicly available.

"Learning to Selectively Transfer: Reinforced Transfer Learning for Deep
  Text Matching","  Deep text matching approaches have been widely studied for many applications
including question answering and information retrieval systems. To deal with a
domain that has insufficient labeled data, these approaches can be used in a
Transfer Learning (TL) setting to leverage labeled data from a resource-rich
source domain. To achieve better performance, source domain data selection is
essential in this process to prevent the ""negative transfer"" problem. However,
the emerging deep transfer models do not fit well with most existing data
selection methods, because the data selection policy and the transfer learning
model are not jointly trained, leading to sub-optimal training efficiency.
  In this paper, we propose a novel reinforced data selector to select
high-quality source domain data to help the TL model. Specifically, the data
selector ""acts"" on the source domain data to find a subset for optimization of
the TL model, and the performance of the TL model can provide ""rewards"" in turn
to update the selector. We build the reinforced data selector based on the
actor-critic framework and integrate it to a DNN based transfer learning model,
resulting in a Reinforced Transfer Learning (RTL) method. We perform a thorough
experimental evaluation on two major tasks for text matching, namely,
paraphrase identification and natural language inference. Experimental results
show the proposed RTL can significantly improve the performance of the TL
model. We further investigate different settings of states, rewards, and policy
optimization methods to examine the robustness of our method. Last, we conduct
a case study on the selected data and find our method is able to select source
domain data whose Wasserstein distance is close to the target domain data. This
is reasonable and intuitive as such source domain data can provide more
transferability power to the model.

Multi-Task Learning for Argumentation Mining,"  Multi-task learning has recently become a very active field in deep learning
research. In contrast to learning a single task in isolation, multiple tasks
are learned at the same time, thereby utilizing the training signal of related
tasks to improve the performance on the respective machine learning tasks.
Related work shows various successes in different domains when applying this
paradigm and this thesis extends the existing empirical results by evaluating
multi-task learning in four different scenarios: argumentation mining,
epistemic segmentation, argumentation component segmentation, and
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. We show that multi-task learning can, indeed,
improve the performance compared to single-task learning in all these
scenarios, but may also hurt the performance. Therefore, we investigate the
reasons for successful and less successful applications of this paradigm and
find that dataset properties such as entropy or the size of the label inventory
are good indicators for a potential multi-task learning success and that
multi-task learning is particularly useful if the task at hand suffers from
data sparsity, i.e. a lack of training data. Moreover, multi-task learning is
particularly effective for long input sequences in our experiments. We have
observed this trend in all evaluated scenarios. Finally, we develop a highly
configurable and extensible sequence tagging framework which supports
multi-task learning to conduct our empirical experiments and to aid future
research regarding the multi-task learning paradigm and natural language
processing.

"Deep Learning on FPGAs: Past, Present, and Future","  The rapid growth of data size and accessibility in recent years has
instigated a shift of philosophy in algorithm design for artificial
intelligence. Instead of engineering algorithms by hand, the ability to learn
composable systems automatically from massive amounts of data has led to
ground-breaking performance in important domains such as computer vision,
speech recognition, and natural language processing. The most popular class of
techniques used in these domains is called deep learning, and is seeing
significant attention from industry. However, these models require incredible
amounts of data and compute power to train, and are limited by the need for
better hardware acceleration to accommodate scaling beyond current data and
model sizes. While the current solution has been to use clusters of graphics
processing units (GPU) as general purpose processors (GPGPU), the use of field
programmable gate arrays (FPGA) provide an interesting alternative. Current
trends in design tools for FPGAs have made them more compatible with the
high-level software practices typically practiced in the deep learning
community, making FPGAs more accessible to those who build and deploy models.
Since FPGA architectures are flexible, this could also allow researchers the
ability to explore model-level optimizations beyond what is possible on fixed
architectures such as GPUs. As well, FPGAs tend to provide high performance per
watt of power consumption, which is of particular importance for application
scientists interested in large scale server-based deployment or
resource-limited embedded applications. This review takes a look at deep
learning and FPGAs from a hardware acceleration perspective, identifying trends
and innovations that make these technologies a natural fit, and motivates a
discussion on how FPGAs may best serve the needs of the deep learning community

"Learning Universal Graph Neural Network Embeddings With Aid Of Transfer
  Learning","  Learning powerful data embeddings has become a center piece in machine
learning, especially in natural language processing and computer vision
domains. The crux of these embeddings is that they are pretrained on huge
corpus of data in a unsupervised fashion, sometimes aided with transfer
learning. However currently in the graph learning domain, embeddings learned
through existing graph neural networks (GNNs) are task dependent and thus
cannot be shared across different datasets. In this paper, we present a first
powerful and theoretically guaranteed graph neural network that is designed to
learn task-independent graph embeddings, thereafter referred to as deep
universal graph embedding (DUGNN). Our DUGNN model incorporates a novel graph
neural network (as a universal graph encoder) and leverages rich Graph Kernels
(as a multi-task graph decoder) for both unsupervised learning and
(task-specific) adaptive supervised learning. By learning task-independent
graph embeddings across diverse datasets, DUGNN also reaps the benefits of
transfer learning. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show
that the proposed DUGNN model consistently outperforms both the existing
state-of-art GNN models and Graph Kernels by an increased accuracy of 3% - 8%

Deep Regression Unlearning,"  With the introduction of data protection and privacy regulations, it has
become crucial to remove the lineage of data on demand from a machine learning
(ML) model. In the last few years, there have been notable developments in
machine unlearning to remove the information of certain training data
efficiently and effectively from ML models. In this work, we explore unlearning
for the regression problem, particularly in deep learning models. Unlearning in
classification and simple linear regression has been considerably investigated.
However, unlearning in deep regression models largely remains an untouched
problem till now. In this work, we introduce deep regression unlearning methods
that generalize well and are robust to privacy attacks. We propose the
Blindspot unlearning method which uses a novel weight optimization process. A
randomly initialized model, partially exposed to the retain samples and a copy
of the original model are used together to selectively imprint knowledge about
the data that we wish to keep and scrub off the information of the data we wish
to forget. We also propose a Gaussian fine tuning method for regression
unlearning. The existing unlearning metrics for classification are not directly
applicable to regression unlearning. Therefore, we adapt these metrics for the
regression setting. We conduct regression unlearning experiments for computer
vision, natural language processing and forecasting applications. Our methods
show excellent performance for all these datasets across all the metrics.

DNF-Net: A Neural Architecture for Tabular Data,"  A challenging open question in deep learning is how to handle tabular data.
Unlike domains such as image and natural language processing, where deep

DNF-Net a novel generic architecture whose inductive bias elicits models whose
structure corresponds to logical Boolean formulas in disjunctive normal form
(DNF) over affine soft-threshold decision terms. In addition, DNF-Net promotes
localized decisions that are taken over small subsets of the features. We
present an extensive empirical study showing that DNF-Nets significantly and
consistently outperform FCNs over tabular data. With relatively few
hyperparameters, DNF-Nets open the door to practical end-to-end handling of
tabular data using neural networks. We present ablation studies, which justify
the design choices of DNF-Net including the three inductive bias elements,

Delving into Deep Imbalanced Regression,"  Real-world data often exhibit imbalanced distributions, where certain target
values have significantly fewer observations. Existing techniques for dealing
with imbalanced data focus on targets with categorical indices, i.e., different
classes. However, many tasks involve continuous targets, where hard boundaries
between classes do not exist. We define Deep Imbalanced Regression (DIR) as
learning from such imbalanced data with continuous targets, dealing with
potential missing data for certain target values, and generalizing to the
entire target range. Motivated by the intrinsic difference between categorical
and continuous label space, we propose distribution smoothing for both labels
and features, which explicitly acknowledges the effects of nearby targets, and
calibrates both label and learned feature distributions. We curate and
benchmark large-scale DIR datasets from common real-world tasks in computer
vision, natural language processing, and healthcare domains. Extensive
experiments verify the superior performance of our strategies. Our work fills
the gap in benchmarks and techniques for practical imbalanced regression
problems. Code and data are available at

"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to reduce construction loss in JPEG
  compression caused by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)","  In recent decades, digital image processing has gained enormous popularity.
Consequently, a number of data compression strategies have been put forth, with
the goal of minimizing the amount of information required to represent images.
Among them, JPEG compression is one of the most popular methods that has been
widely applied in multimedia and digital applications. The periodic nature of
DFT makes it impossible to meet the periodic condition of an image's opposing
edges without producing severe artifacts, which lowers the image's perceptual
visual quality. On the other hand, deep learning has recently achieved
outstanding results for applications like speech recognition, image reduction,
and natural language processing. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have
received more attention than most other types of deep neural networks. The use
of convolution in feature extraction results in a less redundant feature map
and a smaller dataset, both of which are crucial for image compression. In this
work, an effective image compression method is purposed using autoencoders. The
study's findings revealed a number of important trends that suggested better
reconstruction along with good compression can be achieved using autoencoders.

Adaptive Transfer Learning of Multi-View Time Series Classification,"  Time Series Classification (TSC) has been an important and challenging task
in data mining, especially on multivariate time series and multi-view time
series data sets. Meanwhile, transfer learning has been widely applied in
computer vision and natural language processing applications to improve deep

applied transfer learning framework to time series mining problems.
Particularly, the technique of measuring similarities between source domain and
target domain based on dynamic representation such as density estimation with
importance sampling has never been combined with transfer learning framework.
In this paper, we first proposed a general adaptive transfer learning framework
for multi-view time series data, which shows strong ability in storing
inter-view importance value in the process of knowledge transfer. Next, we
represented inter-view importance through some time series similarity
measurements and approximated the posterior distribution in latent space for
the importance sampling via density estimation techniques. We then computed the
matrix norm of sampled importance value, which controls the degree of knowledge
transfer in pre-training process. We further evaluated our work, applied it to
many other time series classification tasks, and observed that our architecture
maintained desirable generalization ability. Finally, we concluded that our

PreTraM: Self-Supervised Pre-training via Connecting Trajectory and Map,"  Deep learning has recently achieved significant progress in trajectory
forecasting. However, the scarcity of trajectory data inhibits the data-hungry
deep-learning models from learning good representations. While mature
representation learning methods exist in computer vision and natural language
processing, these pre-training methods require large-scale data. It is hard to
replicate these approaches in trajectory forecasting due to the lack of
adequate trajectory data (e.g., 34K samples in the nuScenes dataset). To work
around the scarcity of trajectory data, we resort to another data modality
closely related to trajectories-HD-maps, which is abundantly provided in
existing datasets. In this paper, we propose PreTraM, a self-supervised
pre-training scheme via connecting trajectories and maps for trajectory
forecasting. Specifically, PreTraM consists of two parts: 1) Trajectory-Map
Contrastive Learning, where we project trajectories and maps to a shared

Privacy Guarantees for De-identifying Text Transformations,"  Machine Learning approaches to Natural Language Processing tasks benefit from
a comprehensive collection of real-life user data. At the same time, there is a
clear need for protecting the privacy of the users whose data is collected and
processed. For text collections, such as, e.g., transcripts of voice
interactions or patient records, replacing sensitive parts with benign
alternatives can provide de-identification. However, how much privacy is
actually guaranteed by such text transformations, and are the resulting texts
still useful for machine learning? In this paper, we derive formal privacy
guarantees for general text transformation-based de-identification methods on
the basis of Differential Privacy. We also measure the effect that different
ways of masking private information in dialog transcripts have on a subsequent
machine learning task. To this end, we formulate different masking strategies
and compare their privacy-utility trade-offs. In particular, we compare a
simple redact approach with more sophisticated word-by-word replacement using
deep learning models on multiple natural language understanding tasks like
named entity recognition, intent detection, and dialog act classification. We
find that only word-by-word replacement is robust against performance drops in
various tasks.

Labeled Data Generation with Inexact Supervision,"  The recent advanced deep learning techniques have shown the promising results
in various domains such as computer vision and natural language processing. The
success of deep neural networks in supervised learning heavily relies on a
large amount of labeled data. However, obtaining labeled data with target
labels is often challenging due to various reasons such as cost of labeling and
privacy issues, which challenges existing deep models. In spite of that, it is
relatively easy to obtain data with \textit{inexact supervision}, i.e., having
labels/tags related to the target task. For example, social media platforms are
overwhelmed with billions of posts and images with self-customized tags, which
are not the exact labels for target classification tasks but are usually
related to the target labels. It is promising to leverage these tags (inexact
supervision) and their relations with target classes to generate labeled data
to facilitate the downstream classification tasks. However, the work on this is
rather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem of labeled data generation
with inexact supervision. We propose a novel generative framework named as
ADDES which can synthesize high-quality labeled data for target classification
tasks by learning from data with inexact supervision and the relations between
inexact supervision and target classes. Experimental results on image and text
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADDES for generating
realistic labeled data from inexact supervision to facilitate the target
classification task.

"Pretraining with Artificial Language: Studying Transferable Knowledge in
  Language Models","  We investigate what kind of structural knowledge learned in neural network
encoders is transferable to processing natural language. We design artificial
languages with structural properties that mimic natural language, pretrain
encoders on the data, and see how much performance the encoder exhibits on
downstream tasks in natural language. Our experimental results show that
pretraining with an artificial language with a nesting dependency structure
provides some knowledge transferable to natural language. A follow-up probing
analysis indicates that its success in the transfer is related to the amount of
encoded contextual information and what is transferred is the knowledge of
position-aware context dependence of language. Our results provide insights

BADM: Batch ADMM for Deep Learning,"  Stochastic gradient descent-based algorithms are widely used for training
deep neural networks but often suffer from slow convergence. To address the
challenge, we leverage the framework of the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) to develop a novel data-driven algorithm, called batch ADMM
(BADM). The fundamental idea of the proposed algorithm is to split the training
data into batches, which is further divided into sub-batches where primal and
dual variables are updated to generate global parameters through aggregation.
We evaluate the performance of BADM across various deep learning tasks,
including graph modelling, computer vision, image generation, and natural
language processing. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that BADM
achieves faster convergence and superior testing accuracy compared to other
state-of-the-art optimizers.

Self-supervised Learning: Generative or Contrastive,"  Deep supervised learning has achieved great success in the last decade.
However, its deficiencies of dependence on manual labels and vulnerability to
attacks have driven people to explore a better solution. As an alternative,
self-supervised learning attracts many researchers for its soaring performance
on representation learning in the last several years. Self-supervised
representation learning leverages input data itself as supervision and benefits
almost all types of downstream tasks. In this survey, we take a look into new
self-supervised learning methods for representation in computer vision, natural
language processing, and graph learning. We comprehensively review the existing
empirical methods and summarize them into three main categories according to
their objectives: generative, contrastive, and generative-contrastive
(adversarial). We further investigate related theoretical analysis work to
provide deeper thoughts on how self-supervised learning works. Finally, we
briefly discuss open problems and future directions for self-supervised
learning. An outline slide for the survey is provided.

Towards Deep Conversational Recommendations,"  There has been growing interest in using neural networks and deep learning
techniques to create dialogue systems. Conversational recommendation is an
interesting setting for the scientific exploration of dialogue with natural
language as the associated discourse involves goal-driven dialogue that often
transforms naturally into more free-form chat. This paper provides two
contributions. First, until now there has been no publicly available
large-scale dataset consisting of real-world dialogues centered around
recommendations. To address this issue and to facilitate our exploration here,
we have collected ReDial, a dataset consisting of over 10,000 conversations
centered around the theme of providing movie recommendations. We make this data
available to the community for further research. Second, we use this dataset to
explore multiple facets of conversational recommendations. In particular we
explore new neural architectures, mechanisms, and methods suitable for
composing conversational recommendation systems. Our dataset allows us to
systematically probe model sub-components addressing different parts of the
overall problem domain ranging from: sentiment analysis and cold-start
recommendation generation to detailed aspects of how natural language is used
in this setting in the real world. We combine such sub-components into a
full-blown dialogue system and examine its behavior.

Grounded Language Acquisition From Object and Action Imagery,"  Deep learning approaches to natural language processing have made great
strides in recent years. While these models produce symbols that convey vast
amounts of diverse knowledge, it is unclear how such symbols are grounded in
data from the world. In this paper, we explore the development of a private
language for visual data representation by training emergent language (EL)
encoders/decoders in both i) a traditional referential game environment and ii)
a contrastive learning environment utilizing a within-class matching training
paradigm. An additional classification layer utilizing neural machine
translation and random forest classification was used to transform symbolic
representations (sequences of integer symbols) to class labels. These methods
were applied in two experiments focusing on object recognition and action
recognition. For object recognition, a set of sketches produced by human
participants from real imagery was used (Sketchy dataset) and for action
recognition, 2D trajectories were generated from 3D motion capture systems
(MOVI dataset). In order to interpret the symbols produced for data in each
experiment, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) methods were
used to identify pixel regions indicating semantic features which contribute
evidence towards symbols in learned languages. Additionally, a t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method was used to investigate embeddings
learned by CNN feature extractors.

Multimodal Recommender Systems in the Prediction of Disease Comorbidity,"  While deep-learning based recommender systems utilizing collaborative
filtering have been commonly used for recommendation in other domains, their
application in the medical domain have been limited. In addition to modeling
user-item interactions, we show that deep-learning based recommender systems
can be used to model subject-disease code interactions. Two novel applications
of deep learning-based recommender systems using Neural Collaborative Filtering
(NCF) and Deep Hybrid Filtering (DHF) were utilized for disease diagnosis based
on known past patient comorbidities. Two datasets, one incorporating all
subject-disease code pairs present in the MIMIC-III database, and the other
incorporating the top 50 most commonly occurring diseases, were used for
prediction. Accuracy and Hit Ratio@10 were utilized as metrics to estimate
model performance. The performance of the NCF model making use of the reduced
""top 50"" ICD-9 code dataset was found to be lower (accuracy of ~80% and hit
ratio@10 of 35%) as compared to the performance of the NCF model trained on all
ICD-9 codes (accuracy of ~90% and hit ratio@10 of ~80%). Reasons for the
superior performance of the sparser dataset with all ICD codes can be mainly
attributed to the higher volume of data and the robustness of deep-learning
based recommender systems with modeling sparse data. Additionally, results from
the DHF models reflect better performance than the NCF models, with a better
accuracy of 94.4% and hit ratio@10 of 85.36%, reflecting the importance of the
incorporation of clinical note information. Additionally, compared to
literature reports utilizing primarily natural language processing-based
predictions for the task of ICD-9 code co-occurrence, the novel deep
learning-based recommender systems approach performed better. Overall, the deep
learning-based recommender systems have shown promise in predicting disease
comorbidity.

ChatDev: Communicative Agents for Software Development,"  Software development is a complex task that necessitates cooperation among
multiple members with diverse skills. Numerous studies used deep learning to
improve specific phases in a waterfall model, such as design, coding, and
testing. However, the deep learning model in each phase requires unique
designs, leading to technical inconsistencies across various phases, which
results in a fragmented and ineffective development process. In this paper, we
introduce ChatDev, a chat-powered software development framework in which
specialized agents driven by large language models (LLMs) are guided in what to
communicate (via chat chain) and how to communicate (via communicative
dehallucination). These agents actively contribute to the design, coding, and
testing phases through unified language-based communication, with solutions
derived from their multi-turn dialogues. We found their utilization of natural
language is advantageous for system design, and communicating in programming
language proves helpful in debugging. This paradigm demonstrates how linguistic
communication facilitates multi-agent collaboration, establishing language as a
unifying bridge for autonomous task-solving among LLM agents. The code and data

"Detection of Increased Time Intervals of Anti-Vaccine Tweets for
  COVID-19 Vaccine with BERT Model","  The most effective of the solutions against Covid-19 is the various vaccines
developed. Distrust of vaccines can hinder the rapid and effective use of this
remedy. One of the means of expressing the thoughts of society is social media.
Determining the time intervals during which anti-vaccination increases in
social media can help institutions determine the strategy to be used in
combating anti-vaccination. Recording and tracking every tweet entered with
human labor would be inefficient, so various automation solutions are needed.
In this study, The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT) model, which is a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP)
model, was used. In a dataset of 1506 tweets divided into four different
categories as news, irrelevant, anti-vaccine, and vaccine supporters, the model
was trained with a learning rate of 5e-6 for 25 epochs. To determine the
intervals in which anti-vaccine tweets are concentrated, the categories to
which 652840 tweets belong were determined by using the trained model. The
change of the determined categories overtime was visualized and the events that
could cause the change were determined. As a result of model training, in the
test dataset, the f-score of 0.81 and AUC values for different classes were
obtained as 0.99,0.91, 0.92, 0.92, respectively. In this model, unlike the
studies in the literature, an auxiliary system is designed that provides data
that institutions can use when determining their strategy by measuring and
visualizing the frequency of anti-vaccine tweets in a time interval, different
from detecting and censoring such tweets.

"Psychomatics -- A Multidisciplinary Framework for Understanding
  Artificial Minds","  Although LLMs and other artificial intelligence systems demonstrate cognitive
skills similar to humans, like concept learning and language acquisition, the
way they process information fundamentally differs from biological cognition.
To better understand these differences this paper introduces Psychomatics, a
multidisciplinary framework bridging cognitive science, linguistics, and
computer science. It aims to better understand the high-level functioning of
LLMs, focusing specifically on how LLMs acquire, learn, remember, and use
information to produce their outputs. To achieve this goal, Psychomatics will
rely on a comparative methodology, starting from a theory-driven research
question - is the process of language development and use different in humans
and LLMs? - drawing parallels between LLMs and biological systems. Our analysis
shows how LLMs can map and manipulate complex linguistic patterns in their
training data. Moreover, LLMs can follow Grice's Cooperative Principle to
provide relevant and informative responses. However, human cognition draws from
multiple sources of meaning, including experiential, emotional, and imaginative
facets, which transcend mere language processing and are rooted in our social
and developmental trajectories. Moreover, current LLMs lack physical
embodiment, reducing their ability to make sense of the intricate interplay
between perception, action, and cognition that shapes human understanding and
expression. Ultimately, Psychomatics holds the potential to yield
transformative insights into the nature of language, cognition, and
intelligence, both artificial and biological. Moreover, by drawing parallels
between LLMs and human cognitive processes, Psychomatics can inform the
development of more robust and human-like AI systems.

"Entangling Solid Solutions: Machine Learning of Tensor Networks for

by the development state-of-the-art feature representations and novel deep
learning architectures. A large class of atomic structure representations based

Concurrently, tensor network structures, conventionally the purview of quantum
many-body physics and quantum information, have been successfully applied in
supervised and unsupervised learning tasks in computer vision and natural

networks are well-suited to machine learning on Hilbert-space representations
of atomic structures. This is demonstrated on supervised learning tasks
involving widely available datasets of density functional theory calculations
of metal and semiconductor alloys. In particular, we show that certain standard
tensor network topologies exhibit strong generalizability even on small
training datasets while being parametrically efficient. We further relate this
generalizability to the presence of complex entanglement in the trained tensor
networks. We also discuss connections to learning with generalized structural
kernels and related strategies for compressing large input feature spaces.

long-term dependencies of text for learning. Our approach aims to learn a model
without any code-switching indication, lexical normalization, language
translation, or language transliteration. The model relies entirely upon the
text as no external knowledge base is utilized for learning. For this purpose,
a 12 class bilingual text dataset is developed from SMS feedbacks of citizens

EZLearn: Exploiting Organic Supervision in Large-Scale Data Annotation,"  Many real-world applications require automated data annotation, such as
identifying tissue origins based on gene expressions and classifying images
into semantic categories. Annotation classes are often numerous and subject to
changes over time, and annotating examples has become the major bottleneck for
supervised learning methods. In science and other high-value domains, large
repositories of data samples are often available, together with two sources of
organic supervision: a lexicon for the annotation classes, and text
descriptions that accompany some data samples. Distant supervision has emerged
as a promising paradigm for exploiting such indirect supervision by
automatically annotating examples where the text description contains a class
mention in the lexicon. However, due to linguistic variations and ambiguities,
such training data is inherently noisy, which limits the accuracy of this

"Learning User Preferences and Understanding Calendar Contexts for Event
  Scheduling","  With online calendar services gaining popularity worldwide, calendar data has
become one of the richest context sources for understanding human behavior.
However, event scheduling is still time-consuming even with the development of
online calendars. Although machine learning based event scheduling models have
automated scheduling processes to some extent, they often fail to understand
subtle user preferences and complex calendar contexts with event titles written
in natural language. In this paper, we propose Neural Event Scheduling
Assistant (NESA) which learns user preferences and understands calendar
contexts, directly from raw online calendars for fully automated and highly
effective event scheduling. We leverage over 593K calendar events for NESA to
learn scheduling personal events, and we further utilize NESA for
multi-attendee event scheduling. NESA successfully incorporates deep neural
networks such as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural
Network, and Highway Network for learning the preferences of each user and
understanding calendar context based on natural languages. The experimental
results show that NESA significantly outperforms previous baseline models in
terms of various evaluation metrics on both personal and multi-attendee event
scheduling tasks. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of
each layer in NESA and learned user preferences.

"Translating synthetic natural language to database queries: a polyglot
  deep learning framework","  The number of databases as well as their size and complexity is increasing.
This creates a barrier to use especially for non-experts, who have to come to
grips with the nature of the data, the way it has been represented in the
database, and the specific query languages or user interfaces by which data are
accessed. These difficulties worsen in research settings, where it is common to
work with many different databases. One approach to improving this situation is
to allow users to pose their queries in natural language.
  In this work we describe a machine learning framework, Polyglotter, that in a
general way supports the mapping of natural language searches to database
queries. Importantly, it does not require the creation of manually annotated
data for training and therefore can be applied easily to multiple domains. The
framework is polyglot in the sense that it supports multiple different database
engines that are accessed with a variety of query languages, including SQL and
Cypher. Furthermore Polyglotter also supports multi-class queries.
  Our results indicate that our framework performs well on both synthetic and
real databases, and may provide opportunities for database maintainers to
improve accessibility to their resources.

"Colloquial Persian POS (CPPOS) Corpus: A Novel Corpus for Colloquial
  Persian Part of Speech Tagging","  Introduction: Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging, the process of classifying words
into their respective parts of speech (e.g., verb or noun), is essential in
various natural language processing applications. POS tagging is a crucial
preprocessing task for applications like machine translation, question
answering, sentiment analysis, etc. However, existing corpora for POS tagging
in Persian mainly consist of formal texts, such as daily news and newspapers.
As a result, smart POS tools, machine learning models, and deep learning models
trained on these corpora may not perform optimally for processing colloquial
text in social network analysis. Method: This paper introduces a novel corpus,
""Colloquial Persian POS"" (CPPOS), specifically designed to support colloquial
Persian text. The corpus includes formal and informal text collected from
various domains such as political, social, and commercial on Telegram, Twitter,
and Instagram more than 520K labeled tokens. After collecting posts from these
social platforms for one year, special preprocessing steps were conducted,
including normalization, sentence tokenizing, and word tokenizing for social
text. The tokens and sentences were then manually annotated and verified by a
team of linguistic experts. This study also defines a POS tagging guideline for
annotating the data and conducting the annotation process. Results: To evaluate
the quality of CPPOS, various deep learning models, such as the RNN family,
were trained using the constructed corpus. A comparison with another well-known
Persian POS corpus named ""Bijankhan"" and the Persian Hazm POS tool trained on
Bijankhan revealed that our model trained on CPPOS outperforms them. With the
new corpus and the BiLSTM deep neural model, we achieved a 14% improvement over
the previous dataset.

a composite system involving open data sources for books as well as machine
learning components leveraging deep learning-based techniques for natural
language processing. In particular, we use Siamese neural networks for an
approximate match with known author names, and direct correction of the

"Integration of Neural Network-Based Symbolic Regression in Deep Learning
  for Scientific Discovery","  Symbolic regression is a powerful technique that can discover analytical
equations that describe data, which can lead to explainable models and
generalizability outside of the training data set. In contrast, neural networks
have achieved amazing levels of accuracy on image recognition and natural
language processing tasks, but are often seen as black-box models that are
difficult to interpret and typically extrapolate poorly. Here we use a neural
network-based architecture for symbolic regression called the Equation Learner
(EQL) network and integrate it with other deep learning architectures such that
the whole system can be trained end-to-end through backpropagation. To
demonstrate the power of such systems, we study their performance on several
substantially different tasks. First, we show that the neural network can
perform symbolic regression and learn the form of several functions. Next, we
present an MNIST arithmetic task where a separate part of the neural network
extracts the digits. Finally, we demonstrate prediction of dynamical systems
where an unknown parameter is extracted through an encoder. We find that the
EQL-based architecture can extrapolate quite well outside of the training data
set compared to a standard neural network-based architecture, paving the way
for deep learning to be applied in scientific exploration and discovery.

"On Efficient Training of Large-Scale Deep Learning Models: A Literature
  Review","  The field of deep learning has witnessed significant progress, particularly
in computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and speech. The use
of large-scale models trained on vast amounts of data holds immense promise for
practical applications, enhancing industrial productivity and facilitating
social development. With the increasing demands on computational capacity,
though numerous studies have explored the efficient training, a comprehensive
summarization on acceleration techniques of training deep learning models is
still much anticipated. In this survey, we present a detailed review for
training acceleration. We consider the fundamental update formulation and split
its basic components into five main perspectives: (1) data-centric: including
dataset regularization, data sampling, and data-centric curriculum learning
techniques, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the
data samples; (2) model-centric, including acceleration of basic modules,
compression training, model initialization and model-centric curriculum
learning techniques, which focus on accelerating the training via reducing the
calculations on parameters; (3) optimization-centric, including the selection
of learning rate, the employment of large batchsize, the designs of efficient
objectives, and model average techniques, which pay attention to the training
policy and improving the generality for the large-scale models; (4) budgeted
training, including some distinctive acceleration methods on source-constrained
situations; (5) system-centric, including some efficient open-source
distributed libraries/systems which provide adequate hardware support for the
implementation of acceleration algorithms. By presenting this comprehensive
taxonomy, our survey presents a comprehensive review to understand the general
mechanisms within each component and their joint interaction.

An Inference Approach To Question Answering Over Knowledge Graphs,"  Knowledge Graphs (KG) act as a great tool for holding distilled information
from large natural language text corpora. The problem of natural language
querying over knowledge graphs is essential for the human consumption of this
information. This problem is typically addressed by converting the natural
language query to a structured query and then firing the structured query on
the KG. Direct answering models over knowledge graphs in literature are very
few. The query conversion models and direct models both require specific
training data pertaining to the domain of the knowledge graph. In this work, we
convert the problem of natural language querying over knowledge graphs to an
inference problem over premise-hypothesis pairs. Using trained deep learning
models for the converted proxy inferencing problem, we provide the solution for
the original natural language querying problem. Our method achieves over 90%
accuracy on MetaQA dataset, beating the existing state-of-the-art. We also
propose a model for inferencing called Hierarchical Recurrent Path
Encoder(HRPE). The inferencing models can be fine-tuned to be used across
domains with less training data. Our approach does not require large
domain-specific training data for querying on new knowledge graphs from
different domains.

"An Efficient Architecture for Predicting the Case of Characters using
  Sequence Models","  The dearth of clean textual data often acts as a bottleneck in several
natural language processing applications. The data available often lacks proper
case (uppercase or lowercase) information. This often comes up when text is
obtained from social media, messaging applications and other online platforms.
This paper attempts to solve this problem by restoring the correct case of
characters, commonly known as Truecasing. Doing so improves the accuracy of
several processing tasks further down in the NLP pipeline. Our proposed
architecture uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN),
bi-directional long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and conditional random
fields (CRF), which work at a character level without any explicit feature
engineering. In this study we compare our approach to previous statistical and
deep learning based approaches. Our method shows an increment of 0.83 in F1
score over the current state of the art. Since truecasing acts as a
preprocessing step in several applications, every increment in the F1 score
leads to a significant improvement in the language processing tasks.

Deep Neural Networks with Short Circuits for Improved Gradient Learning,"  Deep neural networks have achieved great success both in computer vision and
natural language processing tasks. However, mostly state-of-art methods highly
rely on external training or computing to improve the performance. To alleviate
the external reliance, we proposed a gradient enhancement approach, conducted
by the short circuit neural connections, to improve the gradient learning of
deep neural networks. The proposed short circuit is a unidirectional connection
that single back propagates the sensitive from the deep layer to the shallows.
Moreover, the short circuit formulates to be a gradient truncation of its
crossing layers which can plug into the backbone deep neural networks without
introducing external training parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate
deep neural networks with our short circuit gain a large margin over the
baselines on both computer vision and natural language processing tasks.

Posing Fair Generalization Tasks for Natural Language Inference,"  Deep learning models for semantics are generally evaluated using naturalistic
corpora. Adversarial methods, in which models are evaluated on new examples
with known semantic properties, have begun to reveal that good performance at
these naturalistic tasks can hide serious shortcomings. However, we should
insist that these evaluations be fair -that the models are given data
sufficient to support the requisite kinds of generalization. In this paper, we
define and motivate a formal notion of fairness in this sense. We then apply
these ideas to natural language inference by constructing very challenging but
provably fair artificial datasets and showing that standard neural models fail
to generalize in the required ways; only task-specific models that jointly
compose the premise and hypothesis are able to achieve high performance, and
even these models do not solve the task perfectly.

"Active$^2$ Learning: Actively reducing redundancies in Active Learning
  methods for Sequence Tagging and Machine Translation","  While deep learning is a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP)
problems, successful solutions to these problems rely heavily on large amounts
of annotated samples. However, manually annotating data is expensive and
time-consuming. Active Learning (AL) strategies reduce the need for huge
volumes of labeled data by iteratively selecting a small number of examples for
manual annotation based on their estimated utility in training the given model.
In this paper, we argue that since AL strategies choose examples independently,
they may potentially select similar examples, all of which may not contribute
significantly to the learning process. Our proposed approach,
Active$\mathbf{^2}$ Learning (A$\mathbf{^2}$L), actively adapts to the deep
learning model being trained to eliminate such redundant examples chosen by an
AL strategy. We show that A$\mathbf{^2}$L is widely applicable by using it in
conjunction with several different AL strategies and NLP tasks. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed approach is further able to reduce the data
requirements of state-of-the-art AL strategies by $\approx \mathbf{3-25\%}$ on
an absolute scale on multiple NLP tasks while achieving the same performance

Data Agnostic RoBERTa-based Natural Language to SQL Query Generation,"  Relational databases are among the most widely used architectures to store

this problem by converting natural language questions into valid SQL queries.
Given the sensitive nature of some databases and the growing need for data
privacy, we have presented an approach with data privacy at its core. We have
passed RoBERTa embeddings and data-agnostic knowledge vectors into LSTM based
submodels to predict the final query. Although we have not achieved state of
the art results, we have eliminated the need for the table data, right from the
training of the model, and have achieved a test set execution accuracy of
76.7%. By eliminating the table data dependency while training we have created
a model capable of zero shot learning based on the natural language question
and table schema alone.

"Towards Coinductive Models for Natural Language Understanding. Bringing
  together Deep Learning and Deep Semantics","  This article contains a proposal to add coinduction to the computational
apparatus of natural language understanding. This, we argue, will provide a
basis for more realistic, computationally sound, and scalable models of natural
language dialogue, syntax and semantics. Given that the bottom up, inductively
constructed, semantic and syntactic structures are brittle, and seemingly
incapable of adequately representing the meaning of longer sentences or
realistic dialogues, natural language understanding is in need of a new
foundation. Coinduction, which uses top down constraints, has been successfully
used in the design of operating systems and programming languages. Moreover,
implicitly it has been present in text mining, machine translation, and in some
attempts to model intensionality and modalities, which provides evidence that
it works. This article shows high level formalizations of some of such uses.
  Since coinduction and induction can coexist, they can provide a common
language and a conceptual model for research in natural language understanding.
In particular, such an opportunity seems to be emerging in research on
compositionality. This article shows several examples of the joint appearance
of induction and coinduction in natural language processing. We argue that the
known individual limitations of induction and coinduction can be overcome in
empirical settings by a combination of the the two methods. We see an open
problem in providing a theory of their joint use.

On Inductive Biases for Machine Learning in Data Constrained Settings,"  Learning with limited data is one of the biggest problems of machine
learning. Current approaches to this issue consist in learning general
representations from huge amounts of data before fine-tuning the model on a
small dataset of interest. While such technique, coined transfer learning, is
very effective in domains such as computer vision or natural langage
processing, it does not yet solve common problems of deep learning such as
model interpretability or the overall need for data. This thesis explores a
different answer to the problem of learning expressive models in data
constrained settings: instead of relying on big datasets to learn neural
networks, we will replace some modules by known functions reflecting the
structure of the data. Very often, these functions will be drawn from the rich
literature of kernel methods. Indeed, many kernels can reflect the underlying
structure of the data, thus sparing learning parameters to some extent. Our
approach falls under the hood of ""inductive biases"", which can be defined as
hypothesis on the data at hand restricting the space of models to explore
during learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in the
context of sequences, such as sentences in natural language or protein
sequences, and graphs, such as molecules. We also highlight the relationship
between our work and recent advances in deep learning. Additionally, we study
convex machine learning models. Here, rather than proposing new models, we
wonder which proportion of the samples in a dataset is really needed to learn a
""good"" model. More precisely, we study the problem of safe sample screening,
i.e, executing simple tests to discard uninformative samples from a dataset
even before fitting a machine learning model, without affecting the optimal
model. Such techniques can be used to prune datasets or mine for rare samples.

"Diversified Ensemble of Independent Sub-Networks for Robust
  Self-Supervised Representation Learning","  Ensembling a neural network is a widely recognized approach to enhance model
performance, estimate uncertainty, and improve robustness in deep supervised

memory demands. In addition, the efficiency of a deep ensemble is related to
diversity among the ensemble members which is challenging for large,
over-parameterized deep neural networks. Moreover, ensemble learning has not
yet seen such widespread adoption, and it remains a challenging endeavor for
self-supervised or unsupervised representation learning. Motivated by these
challenges, we present a novel self-supervised training regime that leverages
an ensemble of independent sub-networks, complemented by a new loss function
designed to encourage diversity. Our method efficiently builds a sub-model
ensemble with high diversity, leading to well-calibrated estimates of model
uncertainty, all achieved with minimal computational overhead compared to
traditional deep self-supervised ensembles. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across various tasks,
including in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution detection,
dataset corruption, and semi-supervised settings. The results demonstrate that
our method significantly improves prediction reliability. Our approach not only
achieves excellent accuracy but also enhances calibration, surpassing baseline

further his work by testing out different variations of RNN models with CNN.
Specifically, we have divided the challenge into two parts: data processing and
sampling and choosing the optimal deep learning architecture. In preprocessing,
we experimented with two techniques, SMOTE and Class Weights to counter the
imbalance between classes. Once we are happy with the quality of our input
data, we proceed to choosing the optimal deep learning architecture for this
task. Given the quality and quantity of data we have been given, we found that
the addition of CNN layer provides very little to no additional improvement to

Optimizing Federated Learning by Entropy-Based Client Selection,"  Deep learning is an emerging field revolutionizing various industries,
including natural language processing, computer vision, and many more. These
domains typically require an extensive amount of data for optimal performance,
potentially utilizing huge centralized data repositories. However, such
centralization could raise privacy issues concerning the storage of sensitive
data. To address this issue, federated learning was developed. It is a newly
distributed learning technique that enables to collaboratively train a deep
learning model on decentralized devices, referred to as clients, without
compromising their data privacy. Traditional federated learning methods often
suffer from severe performance degradation when the data distribution among
clients differs significantly. This becomes especially problematic in the case
of label distribution skew, where the distribution of labels varies across
clients. To address this, a novel method called FedEntOpt is proposed.
FedEntOpt is designed to mitigate performance issues caused by label
distribution skew by maximizing the entropy of the global label distribution of
the selected client subset in each federated learning round. This ensures that
the aggregated model parameters from the clients were exhibited to data from
all available labels, which improves the accuracy of the global model.
Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed
method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 6% in
classification accuracy, demonstrating robust and superior performance,
particularly under low participation rates. In addition, it offers the
flexibility to be combined with them, enhancing their performance by over 40%.

"Semi-Supervised Natural Language Approach for Fine-Grained
  Classification of Medical Reports","  Although machine learning has become a powerful tool to augment doctors in
clinical analysis, the immense amount of labeled data that is necessary to
train supervised learning approaches burdens each development task as time and
resource intensive. The vast majority of dense clinical information is stored
in written reports, detailing pertinent patient information. The challenge with
utilizing natural language data for standard model development is due to the
complex nature of the modality. In this research, a model pipeline was
developed to utilize an unsupervised approach to train an encoder-language
model, a recurrent network, to generate document encodings; which then can be
used as features passed into a decoder-classifier model that requires
magnitudes less labeled data than previous approaches to differentiate between
fine-grained disease classes accurately. The language model was trained on
unlabeled radiology reports from the Massachusetts General Hospital Radiology
Department (n=218,159) and terminated with a loss of 1.62. The classification
models were trained on three labeled datasets of head CT studies of reported
patients, presenting large vessel occlusion (n=1403), acute ischemic strokes
(n=331), and intracranial hemorrhage (n=4350), to identify a variety of
different findings directly from the radiology report data; resulting in AUCs
of 0.98, 0.95, and 0.99, respectively, for the large vessel occlusion, acute
ischemic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage datasets. The output encodings are
able to be used in conjunction with imaging data, to create models that can
process a multitude of different modalities. The ability to automatically
extract relevant features from textual data allows for faster model development
and integration of textual modality, overall, allowing clinical reports to
become a more viable input for more encompassing and accurate deep learning
models.

"LINX: A Language Driven Generative System for Goal-Oriented Automated
  Data Exploration","  Data exploration is a challenging process in which users examine a dataset by
iteratively employing a series of queries. While in some cases the user
explores a new dataset to become familiar with it, more often, the exploration
process is conducted with a specific analysis goal or question in mind. To
assist users in exploring a new dataset, Automated Data Exploration (ADE)
systems have been devised in previous work. These systems aim to auto-generate
a full exploration session, containing a sequence of queries that showcase
interesting elements of the data. However, existing ADE systems are often
constrained by a predefined objective function, thus always generating the same
session for a given dataset. Therefore, their effectiveness in goal-oriented
exploration, in which users need to answer specific questions about the data,
are extremely limited.
  To this end, this paper presents LINX, a generative system augmented with a
natural language interface for goal-oriented ADE. Given an input dataset and an
analytical goal described in natural language, LINX generates a personalized
exploratory session that is relevant to the user's goal. LINX utilizes a Large
Language Model (LLM) to interpret the input analysis goal, and then derive a
set of specifications for the desired output exploration session. These
specifications are then transferred to a novel, modular ADE engine based on
Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CDRL), which can adapt its output
according to the specified instructions.
  To validate LINX's effectiveness, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for
goal-oriented exploration and conduct an extensive user study. Our analysis
underscores LINX's superior capability in producing exploratory notebooks that
are significantly more relevant and beneficial than those generated by existing
solutions, including ChatGPT, goal-agnostic ADE, and commercial systems.

"PID Control-Based Self-Healing to Improve the Robustness of Large
  Language Models","  Despite the effectiveness of deep neural networks in numerous natural
language processing applications, recent findings have exposed the
vulnerability of these language models when minor perturbations are introduced.
While appearing semantically indistinguishable to humans, these perturbations
can significantly reduce the performance of well-trained language models,
raising concerns about the reliability of deploying them in safe-critical
situations. In this work, we construct a computationally efficient self-healing
process to correct undesired model behavior during online inference when
perturbations are applied to input data. This is formulated as a trajectory
optimization problem in which the internal states of the neural network layers
are automatically corrected using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative)
control mechanism. The P controller targets immediate state adjustments, while
the I and D controllers consider past states and future dynamical trends,
respectively. We leverage the geometrical properties of the training data to
design effective linear PID controllers. This approach reduces the
computational cost to that of using just the P controller, instead of the full
PID control. Further, we introduce an analytical method for approximating the
optimal control solutions, enhancing the real-time inference capabilities of
this controlled system. Moreover, we conduct a theoretical error analysis of
the analytic solution in a simplified setting. The proposed PID control-based
self-healing is a low cost framework that improves the robustness of
pre-trained large language models, whether standard or robustly trained,
against a wide range of perturbations. A detailed implementation can be found

Deep Image-to-Recipe Translation,"  The modern saying, ""You Are What You Eat"" resonates on a profound level,
reflecting the intricate connection between our identities and the food we
consume. Our project, Deep Image-to-Recipe Translation, is an intersection of
computer vision and natural language generation that aims to bridge the gap
between cherished food memories and the art of culinary creation. Our primary
objective involves predicting ingredients from a given food image. For this
task, we first develop a custom convolutional network and then compare its
performance to a model that leverages transfer learning. We pursue an
additional goal of generating a comprehensive set of recipe steps from a list
of ingredients. We frame this process as a sequence-to-sequence task and
develop a recurrent neural network that utilizes pre-trained word embeddings.
We address several challenges of deep learning including imbalanced datasets,
data cleaning, overfitting, and hyperparameter selection. Our approach
emphasizes the importance of metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and
F1 score in scenarios where accuracy alone might be misleading. For our recipe
prediction model, we employ perplexity, a commonly used and important metric
for language models. We find that transfer learning via pre-trained ResNet-50
weights and GloVe embeddings provide an exceptional boost to model performance,
especially when considering training resource constraints. Although we have
made progress on the image-to-recipe translation, there is an opportunity for
future exploration with advancements in model architectures, dataset
scalability, and enhanced user interaction.

"Language acquisition: do children and language models follow similar
  learning stages?","  During language acquisition, children follow a typical sequence of learning
stages, whereby they first learn to categorize phonemes before they develop
their lexicon and eventually master increasingly complex syntactic structures.
However, the computational principles that lead to this learning trajectory
remain largely unknown. To investigate this, we here compare the learning
trajectories of deep language models to those of children. Specifically, we
test whether, during its training, GPT-2 exhibits stages of language
acquisition comparable to those observed in children aged between 18 months and
6 years. For this, we train 48 GPT-2 models from scratch and evaluate their
syntactic and semantic abilities at each training step, using 96 probes curated
from the BLiMP, Zorro and BIG-Bench benchmarks. We then compare these
evaluations with the behavior of 54 children during language production. Our
analyses reveal three main findings. First, similarly to children, the language
models tend to learn linguistic skills in a systematic order. Second, this
learning scheme is parallel: the language tasks that are learned last improve
from the very first training steps. Third, some - but not all - learning stages
are shared between children and these language models. Overall, these results
shed new light on the principles of language acquisition, and highlight
important divergences in how humans and modern algorithms learn to process
natural language.

"Symmetric Kernels with Non-Symmetric Data: A Data-Agnostic Learnability
  Bound","  Kernel ridge regression (KRR) and Gaussian processes (GPs) are fundamental
tools in statistics and machine learning with recent applications to highly
over-parameterized deep neural networks. The ability of these tools to learn a
target function is directly related to the eigenvalues of their kernel sampled
on the input data. Targets having support on higher eigenvalues are more
learnable. While kernels are often highly symmetric objects, the data is often
not. Thus kernel symmetry seems to have little to no bearing on the above
eigenvalues or learnability, making spectral analysis on real-world data
challenging. Here, we show that contrary to this common lure, one may use
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions associated with highly idealized data-measures
to bound learnability on realistic data. As a demonstration, we give a
theoretical lower bound on the sample complexity of copying heads for kernels

Adaptive Prompt Learning-based Few-Shot Sentiment Analysis,"  In the field of natural language processing, sentiment analysis via deep

classification, object localization and object detection.
  2. We give a review on the evolution of deep convolutional neural networks by
providing an extensive overview of the most important network architectures
presented in chronological order of their appearances.

Reversible Architectures for Arbitrarily Deep Residual Neural Networks,"  Recently, deep residual networks have been successfully applied in many
computer vision and natural language processing tasks, pushing the
state-of-the-art performance with deeper and wider architectures. In this work,
we interpret deep residual networks as ordinary differential equations (ODEs),
which have long been studied in mathematics and physics with rich theoretical
and empirical success. From this interpretation, we develop a theoretical
framework on stability and reversibility of deep neural networks, and derive
three reversible neural network architectures that can go arbitrarily deep in
theory. The reversibility property allows a memory-efficient implementation,
which does not need to store the activations for most hidden layers. Together
with the stability of our architectures, this enables training deeper networks
using only modest computational resources. We provide both theoretical analyses
and empirical results. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
architectures against several strong baselines on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and
STL-10 with superior or on-par state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we
show our architectures yield superior results when trained using fewer training
data.

"Leveraging Natural Language Processing to Augment Structured Social
  Determinants of Health Data in the Electronic Health Record","  Objective: Social determinants of health (SDOH) impact health outcomes and
are documented in the electronic health record (EHR) through structured data
and unstructured clinical notes. However, clinical notes often contain more
comprehensive SDOH information, detailing aspects such as status, severity, and
temporality. This work has two primary objectives: i) develop a natural
language processing (NLP) information extraction model to capture detailed SDOH
information and ii) evaluate the information gain achieved by applying the SDOH
extractor to clinical narratives and combining the extracted representations
with existing structured data.
  Materials and Methods: We developed a novel SDOH extractor using a deep
learning entity and relation extraction architecture to characterize SDOH
across various dimensions. In an EHR case study, we applied the SDOH extractor
to a large clinical data set with 225,089 patients and 430,406 notes with
social history sections and compared the extracted SDOH information with
existing structured data.
  Results: The SDOH extractor achieved 0.86 F1 on a withheld test set. In the
EHR case study, we found extracted SDOH information complements existing
structured data with 32% of homeless patients, 19% of current tobacco users,
and 10% of drug users only having these health risk factors documented in the
clinical narrative.
  Conclusions: Utilizing EHR data to identify SDOH health risk factors and
social needs may improve patient care and outcomes. Semantic representations of
text-encoded SDOH information can augment existing structured data, and this
more comprehensive SDOH representation can assist health systems in identifying
and addressing these social needs.

"Listening to Chaotic Whispers: A Deep Learning Framework for
  News-oriented Stock Trend Prediction","  Stock trend prediction plays a critical role in seeking maximized profit from
stock investment. However, precise trend prediction is very difficult since the
highly volatile and non-stationary nature of stock market. Exploding
information on Internet together with advancing development of natural language
processing and text mining techniques have enable investors to unveil market
trends and volatility from online content. Unfortunately, the quality,
trustworthiness and comprehensiveness of online content related to stock market
varies drastically, and a large portion consists of the low-quality news,
comments, or even rumors. To address this challenge, we imitate the learning
process of human beings facing such chaotic online news, driven by three
principles: sequential content dependency, diverse influence, and effective and
efficient learning. In this paper, to capture the first two principles, we
designed a Hybrid Attention Networks to predict the stock trend based on the
sequence of recent related news. Moreover, we apply the self-paced learning
mechanism to imitate the third principle. Extensive experiments on real-world
stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Foundation Model for Composite Materials and Microstructural Analysis,"  The rapid advancement of machine learning has unlocked numerous opportunities
for materials science, particularly in accelerating the design and analysis of
materials. However, a significant challenge lies in the scarcity and high cost
of obtaining high-quality materials datasets. In other fields, such as natural
language processing, foundation models pre-trained on large datasets have
achieved exceptional success in transfer learning, effectively leveraging
latent features to achieve high performance on tasks with limited data. Despite
this progress, the concept of foundation models remains underexplored in
materials science. Here, we present a foundation model specifically designed
for composite materials. Our model is pre-trained on a dataset of short-fiber
composites to learn robust latent features. During transfer learning, the MMAE
accurately predicts homogenized stiffness, with an R2 score reaching as high as
0.959 and consistently exceeding 0.91, even when trained on limited data. These
findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of foundation models in
composite materials. We anticipate extending this approach to more complex
three-dimensional composite materials, polycrystalline materials, and beyond.
Moreover, this framework enables high-accuracy predictions even when
experimental data are scarce, paving the way for more efficient and
cost-effective materials design and analysis.

"CodeGRU: Context-aware Deep Learning with Gated Recurrent Unit for
  Source Code Modeling","  Recently deep learning based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have
shown great potential in the modeling of source code. However, a major
limitation of these approaches is that they take source code as simple tokens
of text and ignore its contextual, syntactical and structural dependencies. In
this work, we present CodeGRU, a gated recurrent unit based source code
language model that is capable of capturing source code's contextual,
syntactical and structural dependencies. We introduce a novel approach which
can capture the source code context by leveraging the source code token types.
Further, we adopt a novel approach which can learn variable size context by
taking into account source code's syntax, and structural information. We
evaluate CodeGRU with real-world data set and it shows that CodeGRU outperforms
the state-of-the-art language models and help reduce the vocabulary size up to
24.93\%. Unlike previous works, we tested CodeGRU with an independent test set
which suggests that our methodology does not requisite the source code comes
from the same domain as training data while providing suggestions. We further
evaluate CodeGRU with two software engineering applications: source code
suggestion, and source code completion. Our experiment confirms that the source
code's contextual information can be vital and can help improve the software
language models. The extensive evaluation of CodeGRU shows that it outperforms
the state-of-the-art models. The results further suggest that the proposed
approach can help reduce the vocabulary size and is of practical use for
software developers.

Named entity recognition in resumes,"  Named entity recognition (NER) is used to extract information from various
documents and texts such as names and dates. It is important to extract
education and work experience information from resumes in order to filter them.
Considering the fact that all information in a resume has to be entered to the
companys system manually, automatizing this process will save time of the
companies. In this study, a deep learning-based semi-automatic named entity
recognition system has been implemented with a focus on resumes in the field of
IT. Firstly, resumes of employees from five different IT related fields has
been annotated. Six transformer based pre-trained models have been adapted to
named entity recognition problem using the annotated data. These models have
been selected among popular models in the natural language processing field.

reproducibility and accessibility. Our models are evaluated for 9 languages
giving an accurate overview of their strengths. Furthermore, we offer

On Learning the Structure of Clusters in Graphs,"  Graph clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning, with
numerous applications in computer science and in analysing real-world data. In
many real-world applications, we find that the clusters have a significant
high-level structure. This is often overlooked in the design and analysis of
graph clustering algorithms which make strong simplifying assumptions about the
structure of the graph. This thesis addresses the natural question of whether
the structure of clusters can be learned efficiently and describes four new
algorithmic results for learning such structure in graphs and hypergraphs.
  All of the presented theoretical results are extensively evaluated on both
synthetic and real-word datasets of different domains, including image

pretrained models are known to learn complex patterns from data, they may fail
to understand some properties of source code. To test diverse aspects of code
understanding, we introduce a set of diagnosting probing tasks. We show that
pretrained models of code indeed contain information about code syntactic
structure and correctness, the notions of identifiers, data flow and
namespaces, and natural language naming. We also investigate how probing
results are affected by using code-specific pretraining objectives, varying the

allowing information retrieval by voice synthesis, voice recognition, and
natural language processing. These voice assistants can be found in many
modern-day devices such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung. This project is

response.
  The motivation for this project comes from the race and gender bias that

by the male gender, and because of this, many of the products produced do not
regard women. This bias has an impact on natural language processing. This
project will be utilizing various open-source projects to implement machine
learning algorithms and train the assistant algorithm to recognize different
types of voices, accents, and dialects. Through this project, the goal to use
voice data from underrepresented groups to build a voice assistant that can
recognize voices regardless of gender, race, or accent. Increasing the
representation of women in the computer industry is important for the future of
the industry. By representing women in the initial study of voice assistants,

Answer ranking in Community Question Answering: a deep learning approach,"  Community Question Answering is the field of computational linguistics that
deals with problems derived from the questions and answers posted to websites
such as Quora or Stack Overflow. Among some of these problems we find the issue
of ranking the multiple answers posted in reply to each question by how
informative they are in the attempt to solve the original question. This work
tries to advance the state of the art on answer ranking for community Question
Answering by proceeding with a deep learning approach. We started off by
creating a large data set of questions and answers posted to the Stack Overflow
website.
  We then leveraged the natural language processing capabilities of dense
embeddings and LSTM networks to produce a prediction for the accepted answer
attribute, and present the answers in a ranked form ordered by how likely they
are to be marked as accepted by the question asker. We also produced a set of
numerical features to assist with the answer ranking task. These numerical
features were either extracted from metadata found in the Stack Overflow posts
or derived from the questions and answers texts. We compared the performance of
our deep learning models against a set of forest and boosted trees ensemble
methods and found that our models could not improve the best baseline results.
We speculate that this lack of performance improvement versus the baseline
models may be caused by the large number of out of vocabulary words present in
the programming code snippets found in the questions and answers text. We
conclude that while a deep learning approach may be helpful in answer ranking
problems new methods should be developed to assist with the large number of out
of vocabulary words present in the programming code snippets

like image classification and natural language processing, have recently been
applied to source code analysis too, due to the enormous amount of freely
available source code (e.g., from open-source software repositories).
  In this work, we elaborate upon a state-of-the-art approach to the
representation of source code that uses information about its syntactic
structure, and we adapt it to represent source changes (i.e., commits). We use
this representation to classify security-relevant commits.
  Because our method uses transfer learning (that is, we train a network on a
""pretext task"" for which abundant labeled data is available, and then we use
such network for the target task of commit classification, for which fewer
labeled instances are available), we studied the impact of pre-training the
network using two different pretext tasks versus a randomly initialized model.
  Our results indicate that representations that leverage the structural
information obtained through code syntax outperform token-based
representations. Furthermore, the performance metrics obtained when
pre-training on a loosely related pretext task with a very large dataset
($>10^6$ samples) were surpassed when pretraining on a smaller dataset ($>10^4$
samples) but for a pretext task that is more closely related to the target

Review of Deep Learning,"  In recent years, China, the United States and other countries, Google and
other high-tech companies have increased investment in artificial intelligence.
Deep learning is one of the current artificial intelligence research's key
areas. This paper analyzes and summarizes the latest progress and future
research directions of deep learning. Firstly, three basic models of deep
learning are outlined, including multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural
networks, and recurrent neural networks. On this basis, we further analyze the
emerging new models of convolution neural networks and recurrent neural
networks. This paper then summarizes deep learning's applications in many areas
of artificial intelligence, including speech processing, computer vision,
natural language processing and so on. Finally, this paper discusses the
existing problems of deep learning and gives the corresponding possible
solutions.

"A Survey of Active Learning for Text Classification using Deep Neural
  Networks","  Natural language processing (NLP) and neural networks (NNs) have both
undergone significant changes in recent years. For active learning (AL)
purposes, NNs are, however, less commonly used -- despite their current
popularity. By using the superior text classification performance of NNs for
AL, we can either increase a model's performance using the same amount of data
or reduce the data and therefore the required annotation efforts while keeping
the same performance. We review AL for text classification using deep neural
networks (DNNs) and elaborate on two main causes which used to hinder the
adoption: (a) the inability of NNs to provide reliable uncertainty estimates,
on which the most commonly used query strategies rely, and (b) the challenge of
training DNNs on small data. To investigate the former, we construct a taxonomy
of query strategies, which distinguishes between data-based, model-based, and
prediction-based instance selection, and investigate the prevalence of these
classes in recent research. Moreover, we review recent NN-based advances in NLP
like word embeddings or language models in the context of (D)NNs, survey the
current state-of-the-art at the intersection of AL, text classification, and
DNNs and relate recent advances in NLP to AL. Finally, we analyze recent work
in AL for text classification, connect the respective query strategies to the
taxonomy, and outline commonalities and shortcomings. As a result, we highlight
gaps in current research and present open research questions.

"Learning Neural Models for Natural Language Processing in the Face of
  Distributional Shift","  The dominating NLP paradigm of training a strong neural predictor to perform
one task on a specific dataset has led to state-of-the-art performance in a
variety of applications (eg. sentiment classification, span-prediction based
question answering or machine translation). However, it builds upon the
assumption that the data distribution is stationary, ie. that the data is
sampled from a fixed distribution both at training and test time. This way of
training is inconsistent with how we as humans are able to learn from and
operate within a constantly changing stream of information. Moreover, it is
ill-adapted to real-world use cases where the data distribution is expected to
shift over the course of a model's lifetime.
  The first goal of this thesis is to characterize the different forms this
shift can take in the context of natural language processing, and propose
benchmarks and evaluation metrics to measure its effect on current deep
learning architectures. We then proceed to take steps to mitigate the effect of
distributional shift on NLP models. To this end, we develop methods based on
parametric reformulations of the distributionally robust optimization
framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that these approaches yield more robust
models as demonstrated on a selection of realistic problems. In the third and
final part of this thesis, we explore ways of efficiently adapting existing
models to new domains or tasks. Our contribution to this topic takes
inspiration from information geometry to derive a new gradient update rule
which alleviate catastrophic forgetting issues during adaptation.

Visualizing RNN States with Predictive Semantic Encodings,"  Recurrent Neural Networks are an effective and prevalent tool used to model
sequential data such as natural language text. However, their deep nature and

precisely how they work. We present a visual technique that gives a high level
intuition behind the semantics of the hidden states within Recurrent Neural

throughout the model independent of their internal details. The proposed
technique is displayed in a proof of concept visualization tool which is
demonstrated to visualize the natural language processing task of language
modelling.

Learning a Deep Generative Model like a Program: the Free Category Prior,"  Humans surpass the cognitive abilities of most other animals in our ability
to ""chunk"" concepts into words, and then combine the words to combine the
concepts. In this process, we make ""infinite use of finite means"", enabling us
to learn new concepts quickly and nest concepts within each-other. While
program induction and synthesis remain at the heart of foundational theories of
artificial intelligence, only recently has the community moved forward in
attempting to use program learning as a benchmark task itself. The cognitive
science community has thus often assumed that if the brain has simulation and
reasoning capabilities equivalent to a universal computer, then it must employ
a serialized, symbolic representation. Here we confront that assumption, and
provide a counterexample in which compositionality is expressed via network
structure: the free category prior over programs. We show how our formalism
allows neural networks to serve as primitives in probabilistic programs. We
learn both program structure and model parameters end-to-end.

"Are Words Enough? On the semantic conditioning of affective music
  generation","  Music has been commonly recognized as a means of expressing emotions. In this
sense, an intense debate emerges from the need to verbalize musical emotions.
This concern seems highly relevant today, considering the exponential growth of
natural language processing using deep learning models where it is possible to
prompt semantic propositions to generate music automatically. This scoping
review aims to analyze and discuss the possibilities of music generation
conditioned by emotions. To address this topic, we propose a historical
perspective that encompasses the different disciplines and methods contributing
to this topic. In detail, we review two main paradigms adopted in automatic
music generation: rules-based and machine-learning models. Of note are the deep
learning architectures that aim to generate high-fidelity music from textual
descriptions. These models raise fundamental questions about the expressivity
of music, including whether emotions can be represented with words or expressed
through them. We conclude that overcoming the limitation and ambiguity of
language to express emotions through music, some of the use of deep learning
with natural language has the potential to impact the creative industries by
providing powerful tools to prompt and generate new musical works.

"Learning to Infer from Unlabeled Data: A Semi-supervised Learning
  Approach for Robust Natural Language Inference","  Natural Language Inference (NLI) or Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) aims
at predicting the relation between a pair of sentences (premise and hypothesis)
as entailment, contradiction or semantic independence. Although deep learning
models have shown promising performance for NLI in recent years, they rely on
large scale expensive human-annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning (SSL)
is a popular technique for reducing the reliance on human annotation by
leveraging unlabeled data for training. However, despite its substantial
success on single sentence classification tasks where the challenge in making
use of unlabeled data is to assign ""good enough"" pseudo-labels, for NLI tasks,
the nature of unlabeled data is more complex: one of the sentences in the pair
(usually the hypothesis) along with the class label are missing from the data
and require human annotations, which makes SSL for NLI more challenging. In
this paper, we propose a novel way to incorporate unlabeled data in SSL for NLI
where we use a conditional language model, BART to generate the hypotheses for
the unlabeled sentences (used as premises). Our experiments show that our SSL
framework successfully exploits unlabeled data and substantially improves the
performance of four NLI datasets in low-resource settings. We release our code
at: https://github.com/msadat3/SSL_for_NLI.

"XLDA: Cross-Lingual Data Augmentation for Natural Language Inference and
  Question Answering","  While natural language processing systems often focus on a single language,
multilingual transfer learning has the potential to improve performance,
especially for low-resource languages. We introduce XLDA, cross-lingual data
augmentation, a method that replaces a segment of the input text with its
translation in another language. XLDA enhances performance of all 14 tested
languages of the cross-lingual natural language inference (XNLI) benchmark.
With improvements of up to $4.8\%$, training with XLDA achieves
state-of-the-art performance for Greek, Turkish, and Urdu. XLDA is in contrast
to, and performs markedly better than, a more naive approach that aggregates
examples in various languages in a way that each example is solely in one
language. On the SQuAD question answering task, we see that XLDA provides a
$1.0\%$ performance increase on the English evaluation set. Comprehensive
experiments suggest that most languages are effective as cross-lingual
augmentors, that XLDA is robust to a wide range of translation quality, and
that XLDA is even more effective for randomly initialized models than for
pretrained models.

"The Bottleneck Simulator: A Model-based Deep Reinforcement Learning
  Approach","  Deep reinforcement learning has recently shown many impressive successes.
However, one major obstacle towards applying such methods to real-world
problems is their lack of data-efficiency. To this end, we propose the
Bottleneck Simulator: a model-based reinforcement learning method which
combines a learned, factorized transition model of the environment with rollout
simulations to learn an effective policy from few examples. The learned
transition model employs an abstract, discrete (bottleneck) state, which
increases sample efficiency by reducing the number of model parameters and by
exploiting structural properties of the environment. We provide a mathematical
analysis of the Bottleneck Simulator in terms of fixed points of the learned
policy, which reveals how performance is affected by four distinct sources of
error: an error related to the abstract space structure, an error related to
the transition model estimation variance, an error related to the transition
model estimation bias, and an error related to the transition model class bias.
Finally, we evaluate the Bottleneck Simulator on two natural language
processing tasks: a text adventure game and a real-world, complex dialogue
response selection task. On both tasks, the Bottleneck Simulator yields
excellent performance beating competing approaches.

are located: the captions generated by these systems are the output of a
language model conditioned on the output of an object detector that cannot
capture fine-grained location information. Although language models provide
useful knowledge for image captions, we argue that deep learning image
captioning architectures should also model geometric relations between objects.

"AfroLM: A Self-Active Learning-based Multilingual Pretrained Language
  Model for 23 African Languages","  In recent years, multilingual pre-trained language models have gained
prominence due to their remarkable performance on numerous downstream Natural
Language Processing tasks (NLP). However, pre-training these large multilingual
language models requires a lot of training data, which is not available for
African Languages. Active learning is a semi-supervised learning algorithm, in
which a model consistently and dynamically learns to identify the most
beneficial samples to train itself on, in order to achieve better optimization
and performance on downstream tasks. Furthermore, active learning effectively
and practically addresses real-world data scarcity. Despite all its benefits,
active learning, in the context of NLP and especially multilingual language
models pretraining, has received little consideration. In this paper, we

"Audio-visual Generalised Zero-shot Learning with Cross-modal Attention
  and Language","  Learning to classify video data from classes not included in the training
data, i.e. video-based zero-shot learning, is challenging. We conjecture that
the natural alignment between the audio and visual modalities in video data
provides a rich training signal for learning discriminative multi-modal
representations. Focusing on the relatively underexplored task of audio-visual
zero-shot learning, we propose to learn multi-modal representations from
audio-visual data using cross-modal attention and exploit textual label
embeddings for transferring knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes.
Taking this one step further, in our generalised audio-visual zero-shot
learning setting, we include all the training classes in the test-time search
space which act as distractors and increase the difficulty while making the
setting more realistic. Due to the lack of a unified benchmark in this domain,
we introduce a (generalised) zero-shot learning benchmark on three audio-visual
datasets of varying sizes and difficulty, VGGSound, UCF, and ActivityNet,
ensuring that the unseen test classes do not appear in the dataset used for
supervised training of the backbone deep models. Comparing multiple relevant
and recent methods, we demonstrate that our proposed AVCA model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets. Code and data are available

"Improving the Performance of English-Tamil Statistical Machine
  Translation System using Source-Side Pre-Processing","  Machine Translation is one of the major oldest and the most active research
area in Natural Language Processing. Currently, Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT) dominates the Machine Translation research. Statistical Machine
Translation is an approach to Machine Translation which uses models to learn
translation patterns directly from data, and generalize them to translate a new
unseen text. The SMT approach is largely language independent, i.e. the models
can be applied to any language pair. Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
attempts to generate translations using statistical methods based on bilingual
text corpora. Where such corpora are available, excellent results can be
attained translating similar texts, but such corpora are still not available
for many language pairs. Statistical Machine Translation systems, in general,
have difficulty in handling the morphology on the source or the target side
especially for morphologically rich languages. Errors in morphology or syntax
in the target language can have severe consequences on meaning of the sentence.
They change the grammatical function of words or the understanding of the
sentence through the incorrect tense information in verb. Baseline SMT also
known as Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) system does not
use any linguistic information and it only operates on surface word form.
Recent researches shown that adding linguistic information helps to improve the
accuracy of the translation with less amount of bilingual corpora. Adding
linguistic information can be done using the Factored Statistical Machine
Translation system through pre-processing steps. This paper investigates about
how English side pre-processing is used to improve the accuracy of

pretraining on formally-structured data, and then evaluate the biased learners'
ability to learn typologically-diverse natural languages. Our experimental
setup creates a testbed for hypotheses about inductive bias in human language
learning. We investigate the effect of injecting models with three types of
inductive bias: 1) recursive, hierarchical processing, 2) crossing token-token
relationships that can't be modeled by context-free grammars, and 3) a Zipfian
power-law vocabulary distribution. We show that non-context-free relationships
form the best inductive biases. Our study leverages the capabilities of
transformer models to run controlled language learning experiments that are not
possible to run on humans, and surfaces hypotheses about the structures that
facilitate language learning in both humans and machines.

A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks,"  Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years,
ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition
and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically
represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of
applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are
represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between
objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on
existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep
learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a
comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and
machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the
state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent
graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders,
and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications
of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source
codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of graph neural networks.
Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing
field.

"Instance-based Inductive Deep Transfer Learning by Cross-Dataset
  Querying with Locality Sensitive Hashing","  Supervised learning models are typically trained on a single dataset and the
performance of these models rely heavily on the size of the dataset, i.e.,
amount of data available with the ground truth. Learning algorithms try to
generalize solely based on the data that is presented with during the training.
In this work, we propose an inductive transfer learning method that can augment
learning models by infusing similar instances from different learning tasks in
the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. We propose to use instance
representations from a source dataset, \textit{without inheriting anything}
from the source learning model. Representations of the instances of
\textit{source} \& \textit{target} datasets are learned, retrieval of relevant
source instances is performed using soft-attention mechanism and
\textit{locality sensitive hashing}, and then, augmented into the model during
training on the target dataset. Our approach simultaneously exploits the local
\textit{instance level information} as well as the macro statistical viewpoint
of the dataset. Using this approach we have shown significant improvements for
three major news classification datasets over the baseline. Experimental
evaluations also show that the proposed approach reduces dependency on labeled
data by a significant margin for comparable performance. With our proposed
cross dataset learning procedure we show that one can achieve
competitive/better performance than learning from a single dataset.

"Interpretable Sentence Representation with Variational Autoencoders and
  Attention","  In this thesis, we develop methods to enhance the interpretability of recent
representation learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) while
accounting for the unavailability of annotated data. We choose to leverage
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) due to their efficiency in relating
observations to latent generative factors and their effectiveness in
data-efficient learning and interpretable representation learning. As a first
contribution, we identify and remove unnecessary components in the functioning
scheme of semi-supervised VAEs making them faster, smaller and easier to
design. Our second and main contribution is to use VAEs and Transformers to
build two models with inductive bias to separate information in latent
representations into understandable concepts without annotated data. The first
model, Attention-Driven VAE (ADVAE), is able to separately represent and
control information about syntactic roles in sentences. The second model,
QKVAE, uses separate latent variables to form keys and values for its
Transformer decoder and is able to separate syntactic and semantic information
in its neural representations. In transfer experiments, QKVAE has competitive
performance compared to supervised models and equivalent performance to a
supervised model using 50K annotated samples. Additionally, QKVAE displays
improved syntactic role disentanglement capabilities compared to ADVAE.
Overall, we demonstrate that it is possible to enhance the interpretability of
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for language modeling with
unannotated data in situations where text data is abundant but annotations are
scarce.

Semi-Automated Construction of Food Composition Knowledge Base,"  A food composition knowledge base, which stores the essential phyto-, micro-,
and macro-nutrients of foods is useful for both research and industrial
applications. Although many existing knowledge bases attempt to curate such
information, they are often limited by time-consuming manual curation
processes. Outside of the food science domain, natural language processing
methods that utilize pre-trained language models have recently shown promising
results for extracting knowledge from unstructured text. In this work, we
propose a semi-automated framework for constructing a knowledge base of food
composition from the scientific literature available online. To this end, we
utilize a pre-trained BioBERT language model in an active learning setup that
allows the optimal use of limited training data. Our work demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop models are a step toward AI-assisted food systems that scale
well to the ever-increasing big data.

The Janus System: Multi-paradigm Programming in Prolog and Python,"  Python and Prolog express different programming paradigms, with different
strengths. Python is wildly popular because it is well-structured, easy to use,
and mixes well with thousands of scientific and machine learning programs
written in C. Prolog's logic-based approach provides powerful reasoning
capabilities, especially when combined with constraint evaluation,
probabilistic reasoning, well-founded negation, and other advances. Both
languages have commonalities as well: both are usually written in C, both are
dynamically typed, and both use data structures based on a small number of
recursive types.
  This paper describes the design and implementation of Janus, a system that
tightly combines Prolog and Python into a single process. Janus bi-translates
data structures and offers performance of many hundreds of thousands of
round-trip inter-language calls per second. Although Janus is still new, it has
been used in commercial applications including natural language processing,
visual query answering and robotic automation. Janus was developed for XSB, but
porting Janus code to a second Prolog has been straightforward, indicating that
Janus is a tool that other Prologs may easily adopt.

"Uncertainty-Informed Screening for Safer Solvents Used in the Synthesis
  of Perovskite via Language Models","  The challenge of accurately predicting toxicity of industrial solvents used
in perovskite synthesis is a necessary undertaking but is limited by a lack of
a targeted and structured toxicity data. This paper presents a novel framework
that combines an automated data extraction using language models, and an
uncertainty-informed prediction model to fill data gaps and improve prediction
confidence. First, we have utilized and compared two approaches to
automatically extract relevant data from a corpus of scientific literature on
solvents used in perovskite synthesis: smaller bidirectional language models
like BERT and ELMo are used for their repeatability and deterministic outputs,
while autoregressive large language model (LLM) such as GPT-3.5 is used to
leverage its larger training corpus and better response generation. Our novel
'prompting and verification' technique integrated with an LLM aims at targeted
extraction and refinement, thereby reducing hallucination and improving the
quality of the extracted data using the LLM. Next, the extracted data is fed
into our pre-trained multi-task binary classification deep learning to predict
the ED nature of extracted solvents. We have used a Shannon entropy-based
uncertainty quantification utilizing the class probabilities obtained from the
classification model to quantify uncertainty and identify data gaps in our
predictions. This approach leads to the curation of a structured dataset for
solvents used in perovskite synthesis and their uncertainty-informed virtual
toxicity assessment. Additionally, chord diagrams have been used to visualize
solvent interactions and prioritize those with potential hazards, revealing
that 70% of the solvent interactions were primarily associated with two
specific perovskites.

"Long-range gene expression prediction with token alignment of large
  language model","  Gene expression is a cellular process that plays a fundamental role in human
phenotypical variations and diseases. Despite advances of deep learning models
for gene expression prediction, recent benchmarks have revealed their inability
to learn distal regulatory grammar. Here, we address this challenge by
leveraging a pretrained large language model to enhance gene expression
prediction. We introduce Genetic sequence Token Alignment (GTA), which aligns
genetic sequence features with natural language tokens, allowing for symbolic
reasoning of genomic sequence features via the frozen language model. This
cross-modal adaptation learns the regulatory grammar and allows us to further
incorporate gene-specific human annotations as prompts, enabling in-context
learning that is not possible with existing models. Trained on lymphoblastoid
cells, GTA was evaluated on cells from the Geuvadis consortium and outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Enformer, achieving a Spearman correlation of
0.65, a 10\% improvement. Additionally, GTA offers improved interpretation of
long-range interactions through the identification of the most meaningful
sections of the input genetic context. GTA represents a powerful and novel
cross-modal approach to gene expression prediction by utilizing a pretrained
language model, in a paradigm shift from conventional gene expression models
trained only on sequence data.

"Direct Feedback Alignment Scales to Modern Deep Learning Tasks and
  Architectures","  Despite being the workhorse of deep learning, the backpropagation algorithm
is no panacea. It enforces sequential layer updates, thus preventing efficient
parallelization of the training process. Furthermore, its biological
plausibility is being challenged. Alternative schemes have been devised; yet,
under the constraint of synaptic asymmetry, none have scaled to modern deep
learning tasks and architectures. Here, we challenge this perspective, and
study the applicability of Direct Feedback Alignment to neural view synthesis,
recommender systems, geometric learning, and natural language processing. In
contrast with previous studies limited to computer vision tasks, our findings
show that it successfully trains a large range of state-of-the-art deep

"Predictive Insights into LGBTQ+ Minority Stress: A Transductive
  Exploration of Social Media Discourse","  Individuals who identify as sexual and gender minorities, including lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and others (LGBTQ+) are more likely to
experience poorer health than their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.
One primary source that drives these health disparities is minority stress
(i.e., chronic and social stressors unique to LGBTQ+ communities' experiences
adapting to the dominant culture). This stress is frequently expressed in
LGBTQ+ users' posts on social media platforms. However, these expressions are
not just straightforward manifestations of minority stress. They involve
linguistic complexity (e.g., idiom or lexical diversity), rendering them
challenging for many traditional natural language processing methods to detect.
In this work, we designed a hybrid model using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a pre-trained
deep language model to improve the classification performance of minority
stress detection. We experimented with our model on a benchmark social media
dataset for minority stress detection (LGBTQ+ MiSSoM+). The dataset is
comprised of 5,789 human-annotated Reddit posts from LGBTQ+ subreddits. Our
approach enables the extraction of hidden linguistic nuances through
pretraining on a vast amount of raw data, while also engaging in transductive
learning to jointly develop representations for both labeled training data and
unlabeled test data. The RoBERTa-GCN model achieved an accuracy of 0.86 and an
F1 score of 0.86, surpassing the performance of other baseline models in
predicting LGBTQ+ minority stress. Improved prediction of minority stress
expressions on social media could lead to digital health interventions to
improve the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people-a community with high rates of
stress-sensitive health problems.

"Deep learning for temporal data representation in electronic health
  records: A systematic review of challenges and methodologies","  Objective: Temporal electronic health records (EHRs) can be a wealth of
information for secondary uses, such as clinical events prediction or chronic
disease management. However, challenges exist for temporal data representation.
We therefore sought to identify these challenges and evaluate novel
methodologies for addressing them through a systematic examination of deep
learning solutions.
  Methods: We searched five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE] Xplore Digital Library, the
Association for Computing Machinery [ACM] digital library, and Web of Science)
complemented with hand-searching in several prestigious computer science
conference proceedings. We sought articles that reported deep learning
methodologies on temporal data representation in structured EHR data from
January 1, 2010, to August 30, 2020. We summarized and analyzed the selected
articles from three perspectives: nature of time series, methodology, and model
implementation.
  Results: We included 98 articles related to temporal data representation
using deep learning. Four major challenges were identified, including data
irregularity, data heterogeneity, data sparsity, and model opacity. We then
studied how deep learning techniques were applied to address these challenges.
Finally, we discuss some open challenges arising from deep learning.
  Conclusion: Temporal EHR data present several major challenges for clinical
prediction modeling and data utilization. To some extent, current deep learning
solutions can address these challenges. Future studies can consider designing
comprehensive and integrated solutions. Moreover, researchers should
incorporate additional clinical domain knowledge into study designs and enhance
the interpretability of the model to facilitate its implementation in clinical
practice.

"Recurrent Neural Networks with Mixed Hierarchical Structures and EM
  Algorithm for Natural Language Processing","  How to obtain hierarchical representations with an increasing level of
abstraction becomes one of the key issues of learning with deep neural
networks. A variety of RNN models have recently been proposed to incorporate
both explicit and implicit hierarchical information in modeling languages in

hierarchical structure, which allows us to seamlessly integrate different
levels of attention mechanisms into the structure. We called the resulting

strategies to effectively and efficiently train the EM-HRNN model on long text
documents. Simulation studies and real data applications demonstrate that the
EM-HRNN model with bootstrap training outperforms other RNN-based models in

comparable to a Transformer-based method called Bert-base, though the former is

learning algorithms could facilitate identification and care of vulnerable
clusters of population, such as those having multi-morbidity conditions. In
order to build a useful disease diagnosis prediction system, advancement in
both data representation and development of machine learning architectures are

second, ClinicalBERT_Multi, that incorporates rich information available in

understanding (XLU) and low-resource cross-language transfer. In this work, we
construct an evaluation set for XLU by extending the development and test sets
of the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MultiNLI) to 15
languages, including low-resource languages such as Swahili and Urdu. We hope
that our dataset, dubbed XNLI, will catalyze research in cross-lingual sentence
understanding by providing an informative standard evaluation task. In
addition, we provide several baselines for multilingual sentence understanding,
including two based on machine translation systems, and two that use parallel
data to train aligned multilingual bag-of-words and LSTM encoders. We find that
XNLI represents a practical and challenging evaluation suite, and that directly
translating the test data yields the best performance among available
baselines.

Using Domain Knowledge for Low Resource Named Entity Recognition,"  In recent years, named entity recognition has always been a popular research
in the field of natural language processing, while traditional deep learning
methods require a large amount of labeled data for model training, which makes
them not suitable for areas where labeling resources are scarce. In addition,
the existing cross-domain knowledge transfer methods need to adjust the entity
labels for different fields, so as to increase the training cost. To solve
these problems, enlightened by a processing method of Chinese named entity
recognition, we propose to use domain knowledge to improve the performance of
named entity recognition in areas with low resources. The domain knowledge
mainly applied by us is domain dictionary and domain labeled data. We use
dictionary information for each word to strengthen its word embedding and
domain labeled data to reinforce the recognition effect. The proposed model
avoids large-scale data adjustments in different domains while handling named
entities recognition with low resources. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, which has achieved impressive results on the data
set in the field of scientific and technological equipment, and the F1 score
has been significantly improved compared with many other baseline methods.

Sparsity-based Defense against Adversarial Attacks on Linear Classifiers,"  Deep neural networks represent the state of the art in machine learning in a
growing number of fields, including vision, speech and natural language
processing. However, recent work raises important questions about the
robustness of such architectures, by showing that it is possible to induce
classification errors through tiny, almost imperceptible, perturbations.
Vulnerability to such ""adversarial attacks"", or ""adversarial examples"", has
been conjectured to be due to the excessive linearity of deep networks. In this
paper, we study this phenomenon in the setting of a linear classifier, and show
that it is possible to exploit sparsity in natural data to combat
$\ell_{\infty}$-bounded adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we demonstrate
the efficacy of a sparsifying front end via an ensemble averaged analysis, and
experimental results for the MNIST handwritten digit database. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to show that sparsity provides a
theoretically rigorous framework for defense against adversarial attacks.

FarsTail: A Persian Natural Language Inference Dataset,"  Natural language inference (NLI) is known as one of the central tasks in
natural language processing (NLP) which encapsulates many fundamental aspects
of language understanding. With the considerable achievements of data-hungry
deep learning methods in NLP tasks, a great amount of effort has been devoted
to develop more diverse datasets for different languages. In this paper, we
present a new dataset for the NLI task in the Persian language, also known as
Farsi, which is one of the dominant languages in the Middle East. This dataset,
named FarsTail, includes 10,367 samples which are provided in both the Persian
language as well as the indexed format to be useful for non-Persian
researchers. The samples are generated from 3,539 multiple-choice questions
with the least amount of annotator interventions in a way similar to the
SciTail dataset. A carefully designed multi-step process is adopted to ensure
the quality of the dataset. We also present the results of traditional and
state-of-the-art methods on FarsTail including different embedding methods such
as word2vec, fastText, ELMo, BERT, and LASER, as well as different modeling
approaches such as DecompAtt, ESIM, HBMP, and ULMFiT to provide a solid
baseline for the future research. The best obtained test accuracy is 83.38%
which shows that there is a big room for improving the current methods to be
useful for real-world NLP applications in different languages. We also
investigate the extent to which the models exploit superficial clues, also
known as dataset biases, in FarsTail, and partition the test set into easy and
hard subsets according to the success of biased models. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/dml-qom/FarsTail

"Transparent but Powerful: Explainability, Accuracy, and Generalizability
  in ADHD Detection from Social Media Data","  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent mental health
condition affecting both children and adults, yet it remains severely
underdiagnosed. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), offer promising
solutions for scalable and non-invasive ADHD screening methods using social
media data. This paper presents a comprehensive study on ADHD detection,
leveraging both shallow machine learning models and deep learning approaches,
including BiLSTM and transformer-based models, to analyze linguistic patterns
in ADHD-related social media text. Our results highlight the trade-offs between
interpretability and performance across different models, with BiLSTM offering
a balance of transparency and accuracy. Additionally, we assess the
generalizability of these models using cross-platform data from Reddit and
Twitter, uncovering key linguistic features associated with ADHD that could
contribute to more effective digital screening tools.

The Transformer Network for the Traveling Salesman Problem,"  The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the most popular and most studied
combinatorial problem, starting with von Neumann in 1951. It has driven the
discovery of several optimization techniques such as cutting planes,
branch-and-bound, local search, Lagrangian relaxation, and simulated annealing.
The last five years have seen the emergence of promising techniques where
(graph) neural networks have been capable to learn new combinatorial
algorithms. The main question is whether deep learning can learn better
heuristics from data, i.e. replacing human-engineered heuristics? This is
appealing because developing algorithms to tackle efficiently NP-hard problems
may require years of research, and many industry problems are combinatorial by
nature. In this work, we propose to adapt the recent successful Transformer
architecture originally developed for natural language processing to the
combinatorial TSP. Training is done by reinforcement learning, hence without
TSP training solutions, and decoding uses beam search. We report improved
performances over recent learned heuristics with an optimal gap of 0.004% for
TSP50 and 0.39% for TSP100.

"Watch and learn -- a generalized approach for transferrable learning in
  deep neural networks via physical principles","  Transfer learning refers to the use of knowledge gained while solving a
machine learning task and applying it to the solution of a closely related
problem. Such an approach has enabled scientific breakthroughs in computer
vision and natural language processing where the weights learned in
state-of-the-art models can be used to initialize models for other tasks which
dramatically improve their performance and save computational time. Here we
demonstrate an unsupervised learning approach augmented with basic physical
principles that achieves fully transferrable learning for problems in
statistical physics across different physical regimes. By coupling a sequence
model based on a recurrent neural network to an extensive deep neural network,
we are able to learn the equilibrium probability distributions and
inter-particle interaction models of classical statistical mechanical systems.
Our approach, distribution-consistent learning, DCL, is a general strategy that
works for a variety of canonical statistical mechanical models (Ising and
Potts) as well as disordered (spin-glass) interaction potentials. Using data
collected from a single set of observation conditions, DCL successfully
extrapolates across all temperatures, thermodynamic phases, and can be applied
to different length-scales. This constitutes a fully transferrable
physics-based learning in a generalizable approach.
