Concentration of ergotropy in many-body systems,"Ergotropy -- the maximal amount of unitarily extractable work -- measures the
``charge level'' of quantum batteries. We prove that in large many-body
batteries ergotropy exhibits a concentration of measure phenomenon. Namely, the
ergotropy of such systems is almost constant for almost all states sampled from
the Hilbert--Schmidt measure. We establish this by first proving that
ergotropy, as a function of the state, is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to
the Bures distance, and then applying Levy's measure concentration lemma. In
parallel, we showcase the analogous properties of von Neumann entropy,
compiling and adapting known results about its continuity and concentration
properties. Furthermore, we consider the situation with the least amount of
prior information about the state. This corresponds to the quantum version of
the Jeffreys prior distribution -- the Bures measure. In this case, there exist
no analytical bounds guaranteeing exponential concentration of measure.
Nonetheless, we provide numerical evidence that ergotropy, as well as von
Neumann entropy, concentrate also in this case.",2024-12-27T18:58:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19801v1,"Karen V. Hovhannisyan, Rick P. A. Simon, Janet Anders"
Entangled dual-comb spectroscopy,"Optical frequency combs have emerged as a cornerstone for a wide range of
areas, including spectroscopy, ranging, optical clocks, time and frequency
transfer, waveform synthesis, and communications. However, quantum mechanical
fluctuations of the optical carrier impose fundamental performance limits on
the precision of traditional classical laser frequency combs, particularly in
their use for interferometry and spectroscopy. Entanglement, as a
quintessential quantum resource, allows for surpassing the fundamental limits
of classical systems. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate
entangled dual-comb spectroscopy (EDCS) that surmounts the fundamental limits
of classical DCS. EDCS builds on tailored entangled spectral structures of the
frequency combs, enabling simultaneous detection of all comb lines below the
standard quantum limit of classical DCS. Applying EDCS in gas detection, we
achieve a 2.6 dB enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio and a 1.7-fold reduction
in integration time over classical DCS, rendering EDCS particularly suited for
dynamic chemical and biological sensing, where fast, precise measurements
subject to power constraints are required. EDCS represents a new paradigm for
quantum frequency combs, underscoring their prospects in a plethora of
applications in precision metrology, spectroscopy, and timekeeping.",2024-12-27T18:57:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19800v1,"Abdulkarim Hariri, Shuai Liu, Haowei Shi, Quntao Zhuang, Xudong Fan, Zheshen Zhang"
Computing Direct Sum Decompositions,"The problems of finding isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules with
certain properties, or determining the indecomposable summands of a module, are
ubiquitous in commutative algebra, group theory, representation theory, and
other fields. The purpose of this work is to describe and prove correctness of
a practical algorithm for computing indecomposable summands of finitely
generated modules over a finitely generated k-algebra, for k a field of
positive characteristic. Our algorithm works over multigraded rings, which
enables the computation of indecomposable summands of coherent sheaves on
subvarieties of toric varieties (in particular, for varieties embedded in
projective space). We also present multiple examples, including some which
present previously unknown phenomena regarding the behavior of summands of
Frobenius pushforwards and syzygies over Artinian rings.",2024-12-27T18:57:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19799v1,"Devlin Mallory, Mahrud Sayrafi"
Non-Scaling Topological Defects and Gravitational Waves in Higgs Portal,"One of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model is the Higgs portal
extension involving a dark Higgs. Dark sectors that include dark matter
candidates, WIMPs, axions, and dark photons, can naturally have this type of
interaction, where the dark Higgs is charged under some symmetry, which may or
may not be spontaneous broken by the vacuum expectation value. In this paper,
using lattice simulations, I show that if the reheating temperature of the
Universe is sufficiently high, topological defects such as domain walls and
cosmic strings associated with these symmetries are naturally formed even if
the symmetries are never restored due to negative thermal mass squareds. This
occurs due to the early Universe's non-adiabatic oscillation of the Higgs
around the onset of oscillation, which overshoots the origin, and tachyonic
instability that enhances fluctuations. The gravitational waves generated by
these topological defects may be very significant due to the energetic
processes induced by matter effects in the hot and dense Universe irrelevant to
the typical energy scale of the dark sector in the vacuum or whether the
symmetry is broken in the vacuum. Alongside earlier studies such as usual phase
transition, melting domain walls and melting cosmic strings scenarios that
assume a symmetric phase in the early Universe, the Higgs portal models
naturally predict local overdensities from topological defects, which may
induce miniclusters and primordial black holes, as well as the gravitational
waves.These phenomena provide novel opportunities to search for such scenarios.
I also perform various numerical simulations for the relevant topic including
melting domain walls and cosmic strings with inflationary and Gaussian
fluctuations, for comparison--which have not been performed previously.",2024-12-27T18:57:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19798v1,Wen Yin
"Streamlined Krylov construction and classification of ergodic Floquet
  systems","We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum
systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared
to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a
one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain. We also suggest a classification of
chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of
Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this
classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising
chain.",2024-12-27T18:56:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19797v1,"Nikita Kolganov, Dmitrii A. Trunin"
"Generalized Grade-of-Membership Estimation for High-dimensional Locally
  Dependent Data","This work focuses on the mixed membership models for multivariate categorical
data widely used for analyzing survey responses and population genetics data.
These grade of membership (GoM) models offer rich modeling power but present
significant estimation challenges for high-dimensional polytomous data. Popular
existing approaches, such as Bayesian MCMC inference, are not scalable and lack
theoretical guarantees in high-dimensional settings. To address this, we first
observe that data from this model can be reformulated as a three-way
(quasi-)tensor, with many subjects responding to many items with varying
numbers of categories. We introduce a novel and simple approach that flattens
the three-way quasi-tensor into a ""fat"" matrix, and then perform a singular
value decomposition of it to estimate parameters by exploiting the singular
subspace geometry. Our fast spectral method can accommodate a broad range of
data distributions with arbitrarily locally dependent noise, which we formalize
as the generalized-GoM models. We establish finite-sample entrywise error
bounds for the generalized-GoM model parameters. This is supported by a new
sharp two-to-infinity singular subspace perturbation theory for locally
dependent and flexibly distributed noise, a contribution of independent
interest. Simulations and applications to data in political surveys, population
genetics, and single-cell sequencing demonstrate our method's superior
performance.",2024-12-27T18:51:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19796v1,"Ling Chen, Chengzhu Huang, Yuqi Gu"
"g-factor theory of Si/SiGe quantum dots: spin-valley and giant
  renormalization effects","Understanding the $g$-factor physics of Si/SiGe quantum dots is crucial for
realizing high-quality spin qubits. While previous work has explained some
aspects of $g$-factor physics in idealized geometries, the results do not
extend to general cases and they miss several important features. Here, we
construct a theory that gives $g$ in terms of readily computable matrix
elements, and can be applied to all Si/SiGe heterostructures of current
interest. As a concrete example, which currently has no $g$-factor
understanding, we study the so-called Wiggle Well structure, containing Ge
concentration oscillations inside the quantum well. Here we find a significant
renormalization of the $g$-factor compared to conventional Si/SiGe quantum
wells. We also uncover a giant $g$-factor suppression of order
$\mathcal{O}(1)$, which arises due to spin-valley coupling, and occurs at
locations of low valley splitting. Our work therefore opens up new avenues for
$g$-factor engineering in Si/SiGe quantum dots.",2024-12-27T18:50:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19795v1,"Benjamin D. Woods, Merritt P. Losert, Robert Joynt, Mark Friesen"
InfAlign: Inference-aware language model alignment,"Language model alignment has become a critical step in training modern
generative language models. The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference
model such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample
from the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today,
we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N,
controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than
standard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such
inference-time decoding procedures. We show that the existing alignment
framework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. We then modify
the alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment
(IAPO). We prove that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal
solution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy
against the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with a
transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the KL-regularized
calibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which
involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization
step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. We particularize our study
to two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N
jailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the
highest or lowest reward is selected. We propose specific transformations for
these strategies and demonstrate that our framework offers significant
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for language model
alignment. Empirically, we outperform baselines that are designed without
taking inference-time decoding into consideration by 8-12% and 4-9% on
inference-time win rates over the Anthropic helpfulness and harmlessness dialog
benchmark datasets.",2024-12-27T18:45:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19792v1,"Ananth Balashankar, Ziteng Sun, Jonathan Berant, Jacob Eisenstein, Michael Collins, Adrian Hutter, Jong Lee, Chirag Nagpal, Flavien Prost, Aradhana Sinha, and Ananda Theertha Suresh, Ahmad Beirami"
"Local Characteristic Decomposition of Equilibrium Variables for
  Hyperbolic Systems of Balance Laws","This paper is concerned with high-order numerical methods for hyperbolic
systems of balance laws. Such methods are typically based on high-order
piecewise polynomial reconstructions (interpolations) of the computed discrete
quantities. However, such reconstructions (interpolations) may be oscillatory
unless the reconstruction (interpolation) procedure is applied to the local
characteristic variables via the local characteristic decomposition (LCD).
Another challenge in designing accurate and stable high-order schemes is
related to enforcing a delicate balance between the fluxes, sources, and
nonconservative product terms: a good scheme should be well-balanced (WB) in
the sense that it should be capable of exactly preserving certain (physically
relevant) steady states. One of the ways to ensure that the reconstruction
(interpolation) preserves these steady states is to apply the reconstruction
(interpolation) to the equilibrium variables, which are supposed to be constant
at the steady states. To achieve this goal and to keep the reconstruction
(interpolation) non-oscillatory, we introduce a new LCD of equilibrium
variables. We apply the developed technique to the fifth-order Ai-WENO-Z
interpolation implemented within the WB A-WENO framework recently introduced in
[S. Chu, A. Kurganov, and R. Xin, Beijing J. of Pure and Appl. Math., to
appear], and illustrate its performance on a variety of numerical examples.",2024-12-27T18:45:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19791v1,"Shaoshuai Chu, Alexander Kurganov, Mingye Na, Ruixiao Xin"
"Bottom-up robust modeling for the foraging behavior of Physarum
  polycephalum","The true slime mold \textit{Physarum polycephalum} has the remarkable
capability to perform self-organized activities such as network formation among
food sources. Despite well reproducing the emergence of slime networks,
existing models are limited in the investigation of the minimal mechanisms, at
the microscopic scale, that ensure robust problem-solving capabilities at the
macroscopic scale. To this end, we develop three progressively more complex
multi-agent models to provide a flexible framework to understand the
self-organized foraging and network formation behaviors of \textit{Physarum}.
The hierarchy of models allows for a stepwise investigation of the minimal set
of rules that allow bio-inspired computing agents to achieve the desired
behaviors on nutrient-poor substrates. By introducing a quantitative measure of
connectedness among food sources, we assess the sensitivity of the model to
user-defined and bio-inspired parameters, as well as the robustness of the
model to parameter heterogeneity across agents. We ultimately observe the
robust emergence of pattern formation, in line with experimental evidence.
Overall, our study sheds light onto the basic mechanisms of self-organization
and paves the way towards the development of decentralized strategies for
network formation in engineered systems, focusing on trade-offs between
biological fidelity and computational efficiency.",2024-12-27T18:44:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19790v1,"Damiano Reginato, Daniele Proverbio, Giulia Giordano"
Transmon qutrit-based simulation of spin-1 AKLT systems,"Qutrit-based quantum circuits could help reduce the overall circuit depths,
and hence the noise, when the system of interest has local dimension of three.
Accessing second excited states in superconducting transmons provides a
straightforward hardware realization of three-level systems, or qutrits, useful
for such ternary encoding. In this work, we successfully calibrate pulse gates
to a low error rate to obtain transmon qutrits. We use these qutrits to
simulate one-dimensional spin-1 AKLT states (Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy, and
Tasaki) which exhibit a multitude of interesting phenomena such as
topologically protected ground states, string order and the existence of a
robust Berry phase. We demonstrate the efficacy of qutrit-based simulation by
preparing high-fidelity ground states of the AKLT Hamiltonian with open
boundaries for various chain lengths. We then use ground state preparations of
the perturbed AKLT Hamiltonian with periodic boundaries to calculate the Berry
phase and illustrate non-trivial ground state topology. We further present
scalable methods for preparing the AKLT state and computing its Berry phase,
and use tensor network simulations to establish the advantage of qutrit-based
implementation over qubit-based ones in the presence of noise. Our work
provides a pathway toward more general spin-1 physics simulations using
transmon qutrits, with applications in chemistry, magnetism, and topological
phases of matter.",2024-12-27T18:32:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19786v1,"Keerthi Kumaran, Faisal Alam, Norhan Eassa, Kaelyn Ferris, Xiao Xiao, Lukasz Cincio, Nicholas Bronn, Arnab Banerjee"
"Enhancing Whisper's Accuracy and Speed for Indian Languages through
  Prompt-Tuning and Tokenization","Automatic speech recognition has recently seen a significant advancement with
large foundational models such as Whisper. However, these models often struggle
to perform well in low-resource languages, such as Indian languages. This paper
explores two novel approaches to enhance Whisper's multilingual speech
recognition performance in Indian languages. First, we propose prompt-tuning
with language family information, which enhances Whisper's accuracy in
linguistically similar languages. Second, we introduce a novel tokenizer that
reduces the number of generated tokens, thereby accelerating Whisper's
inference speed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the tokenizer
significantly reduces inference time, while prompt-tuning enhances accuracy
across various Whisper model sizes, including Small, Medium, and Large.
Together, these techniques achieve a balance between optimal WER and inference
speed.",2024-12-27T18:32:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19785v1,"Kumud Tripathi, Raj Gothi, Pankaj Wasnik"

transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant
attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these
sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and

address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We
evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in
providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans,
and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average
accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in
certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for
complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across
different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable
improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing

Cosmological perturbations meet Wheeler DeWitt,"We study solutions of the Wheeler DeWitt (WdW) equation in order to recover
standard results of cosmological perturbation theory. In mini-superspace, we
introduce a dimensionless gravitational coupling $\alpha$ that is typically
very small and functions like $\hbar$ in a WKB expansion. We seek solutions of
the form $\Psi = e^{iS/\alpha} \psi$ that are the closest quantum analog of a
given classical background spacetime. The function $S$ satisfies the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation, while $\psi$ obeys a Schr\""odinger-like equation and
has a clear probabilistic interpretation. By using the semiclassical limit we
express the relation between $\psi$ and the wavefunction of the universe in
perturbation theory, $\psi_P$. We apply our formalism to two main examples. The
first is a scalar field with a purely exponential potential, of which
particularly simple, scaling solutions are known. The other is a slow-roll
scenario expanded in the vicinity of the origin in field space. We discuss
possible deviations from the classical background trajectory as well as the
higher ``time"" derivative terms that are present in the WdW equation but not in
the perturbative approach. We clarify the conditional probability content of
the wavefunctions and how this is related with the standard gauge fixing
procedure in perturbation theory.",2024-12-27T18:25:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19782v1,"Federico Piazza, Siméon Vareilles"

Tensor Network Estimation of Distribution Algorithms,"Tensor networks are a tool first employed in the context of many-body quantum
physics that now have a wide range of uses across the computational sciences,
from numerical methods to machine learning. Methods integrating tensor networks
into evolutionary optimization algorithms have appeared in the recent
literature. In essence, these methods can be understood as replacing the
traditional crossover operation of a genetic algorithm with a tensor
network-based generative model. We investigate these methods from the point of
view that they are Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs). We find that
optimization performance of these methods is not related to the power of the
generative model in a straightforward way. Generative models that are better
(in the sense that they better model the distribution from which their training
data is drawn) do not necessarily result in better performance of the
optimization algorithm they form a part of. This raises the question of how
best to incorporate powerful generative models into optimization routines. In
light of this we find that adding an explicit mutation operator to the output
of the generative model often improves optimization performance.",2024-12-27T18:22:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19780v1,"John Gardiner, Javier Lopez-Piqueres"

"Application of normalizing flows to nuclear many-body perturbation
  theory","Many-body perturbation theory provides a powerful framework to study the
ground state and thermodynamic properties of nuclear matter as well as
associated single-particle potentials and response functions within a
systematic order-by-order expansion. However, computational challenges can
emerge beyond the lowest orders of perturbation theory, especially when
computing both single-particle potentials and response functions, which in
general are complex-valued and require Cauchy principal value calculations of
high-dimensional integrals. We demonstrate that normalizing flows are suitable
for Monte Carlo importance sampling of both regular and irregular functions
appearing in nuclear many-body calculations. Normalizing flows are a class of
machine learning models that can be used to build and sample from complicated
distributions through a bijective mapping from a simple base distribution.
Furthermore, a well-trained model for a certain target integrand can be
efficiently transferred to calculate related integrals with varying physical
conditions. These features can enable more efficient tabulations of nuclear
physics inputs to numerical simulations of supernovae and neutron star mergers

"On the numerical solution of Lasserre relaxations of unconstrained

higher-order Lasserre relaxations of unconstrained binary quadratic
optimization problems. For this we use an interior point method with a
preconditioned conjugate gradient method solving the linear systems. The
preconditioner utilizes the low-rank structure of the solution of the
relaxations. In order to fully exploit this, we need to re-write the moment
relaxations. To treat the arising linear equality constraints we use an
$\ell_1$-penalty approach within the interior-point solver. The efficiency of
this approach is demonstrated by numerical experiments with the MAXCUT and
other randomly generated problems and a comparison with a state-of-the-art
semidefinite solver and the ADMM method. We further propose a hybrid
ADMM-interior-point method that proves to be efficient for certain problem
classes. As a by-product, we observe that the second-order relaxation is often
high enough to deliver a globally optimal solution of the original problem.",2024-12-27T18:17:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19776v1,"Soodeh Habibi, Michal Kocvara, Michael Stingl"
"On the uplift of 4D wormholes in Braneworld models and their 5D
  structure","Recent developments in the consistent embedding of general 4D static and
spherically-symmetric spacetimes in arbitrary single-brane braneworld models
[Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 4, L041501] initiated the program of studying the bulk
structure of braneworld wormholes. In this article, adopting a completely
generic approach, we derive the general conditions that the metric functions of
any braneworld spacetime must satisfy to describe a wormhole structure in the
bulk. Particular emphasis is placed on clarifying the proper uplift of 4D
wormholes, expressed in terms of various radial coordinates on the brane, and
we demonstrate the important role of the circumferential radius metric function
for the embedding. Additionally, the flare-out conditions for braneworld
wormholes are presented for the first time and are found to differ from the
case of flat extra dimensions. To illustrate the method, we first perform the
uplift into the Randall-Sundrum II braneworld model for three well-known 4D
wormhole spacetimes; the effective braneworld wormhole solutions of
Casadio-Fabbri-Mazzacurati and Bronnikov-Kim, and the Simpson-Visser spacetime.
Subsequently, we study their bulk features by means of curvature invariants,
flare-out conditions, energy conditions and embedding diagrams. Our analysis

Direct estimates of irreversibility from time series,"The arrow of time can be quantified through the Kullback-Leibler divergence
($D_{KL}$) between the distributions of forward and reverse trajectories in a
system. Many approaches to estimate this rely on specific models, but the use
of incorrect models can introduce uncontrolled errors. Here, we describe a
model-free method that uses trajectory data directly to estimate the evidence
for irreversibility over finite windows of time. To do this we build on
previous work to identify and correct for errors that arise from limited sample
size. Importantly, our approach accurately recovers $D_{KL} = 0$ in systems
that adhere to detailed balance, and the correct nonzero $D_{KL}$ for data
generated by well understood models of nonequilibrium systems. We apply our
method to trajectories of neural activity in the retina as it responds to
naturalistic inputs, and find evidence of irreversibility in single neurons,
emphasizing the non-Markovian character of these data. These results open new
avenues for investigating how the brain represents the arrow of time.",2024-12-27T18:10:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19772v1,"Trevor GrandPre, Gianluca Teza, William Bialek"
"Fortran2CPP: Automating Fortran-to-C++ Migration using LLMs via
  Multi-Turn Dialogue and Dual-Agent Integration","Migrating Fortran code to C++ is a common task for many scientific computing
teams, driven by the need to leverage modern programming paradigms, enhance
cross-platform compatibility, and improve maintainability. Automating this
translation process using large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, but
the lack of high-quality, specialized datasets has hindered their
effectiveness. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
multi-turn dialogue dataset, Fortran2CPP, specifically designed for
Fortran-to-C++ code migration. Our dataset, significantly larger than existing
alternatives, is generated using a unique LLM-driven, dual-agent pipeline
incorporating iterative compilation, execution, and code repair to ensure high

their performance on two independent benchmarks. Fine-tuning on our dataset led
to remarkable gains, with models achieving up to a 3.31x increase in CodeBLEU
score and a 92\% improvement in compilation success rate. This highlights the
dataset's ability to enhance both the syntactic accuracy and compilability of

"On Universally Free First-Order Extensions of Belnap-Dunn's Four-Valued

universally free versions of Belnap-Dunn's four-valued logic, also known as the
logic of first-degree entailment (FDE), and Nelson's paraconsistent logic QN4
(N-). Both FDE and QN4 are suitable to be interpreted as information-based
logics, that is, logics that are capable of representing the deductive behavior
of possibly inconsistent and incomplete information in a database. Like QN4 and
some non-free first-order extensions of FDE, FFDE and FN4 are endowed with
Kripke-style variable domain semantics, which allows representing the dynamic
aspect of information processing, that is, how a database receives new
information over time, including information about new individuals. We argue,
however, that FFDE and FN4 can better represent the development of inconsistent
and incomplete information states (i.e., configurations of a database) over
time than their non-free versions. First, because they allow for empty domains,
which corresponds to the idea that a database may acknowledge no individual at
all at an early stage of its development. Second, because they allow for empty
names, which get interpreted as information about new individuals is inserted
into the database. Also, both systems include an identity predicate that is

realistically model natural scenes. In this paper, we demonstrate that through
a careful design of a generative video propagation framework, various video
tasks can be addressed in a unified way by leveraging the generative power of
such models. Specifically, our framework, GenProp, encodes the original video
with a selective content encoder and propagates the changes made to the first
frame using an image-to-video generation model. We propose a data generation
scheme to cover multiple video tasks based on instance-level video segmentation
datasets. Our model is trained by incorporating a mask prediction decoder head
and optimizing a region-aware loss to aid the encoder to preserve the original
content while the generation model propagates the modified region. This novel
design opens up new possibilities: In editing scenarios, GenProp allows
substantial changes to an object's shape; for insertion, the inserted objects
can exhibit independent motion; for removal, GenProp effectively removes
effects like shadows and reflections from the whole video; for tracking,
GenProp is capable of tracking objects and their associated effects together.
Experiment results demonstrate the leading performance of our model in various
video tasks, and we further provide in-depth analyses of the proposed
framework.",2024-12-27T17:42:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19761v1,"Shaoteng Liu, Tianyu Wang, Jui-Hsien Wang, Qing Liu, Zhifei Zhang, Joon-Young Lee, Yijun Li, Bei Yu, Zhe Lin, Soo Ye Kim, Jiaya Jia"

Complement or substitute? How AI increases the demand for human skills,"The question of whether AI substitutes or complements human work is central
to debates on the future of work. This paper examines the impact of AI on skill
demand and compensation in the U.S. economy, analysing 12 million online job
vacancies from 2018 to 2023. It investigates internal effects (within-job
substitution and complementation) and external effects (across occupations,
industries, and regions). Our findings reveal a significant increase in demand
for AI-complementary skills, such as digital literacy, teamwork, and
resilience, alongside rising wage premiums for these skills in AI roles like
Data Scientist. Conversely, substitute skills, including customer service and
text review, have declined in both demand and value within AI-related
positions. Examining external effects, we find a notable rise in demand for
complementary skills in non-AI roles linked to the growth of AI-related jobs in
specific industries or regions. At the same time, there is a moderate decline
in non-AI roles requiring substitute skills. Overall, AI's complementary effect
is up to 50% larger than its substitution effect, resulting in net positive
demand for skills. These results, replicated for the UK and Australia,
highlight AI's transformative impact on workforce skill requirements. They
suggest reskilling efforts should prioritise not only technical AI skills but
also complementary skills like ethics and digital literacy.",2024-12-27T17:26:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19754v1,"Elina Mäkelä, Fabian Stephany"
Right-handed neutrino production through first-generation leptoquarks,"The collider phenomenology of leptoquarks (LQs) and right-handed neutrinos
(RHNs) has been studied extensively in the literature. Because of the gauge
singlet nature, the production of RHNs at the LHC is typically suppressed by
the tiny light-heavy neutrino mixing angles. In this study, we explore a
promising scenario where the presence of an LQ mediator significantly enhances
RHN production. We focus on first-generation scalar and vector LQs interacting
with the first-generation RHN. The prospects are better for the
first-generation scenario than the other generations because of the enhanced
parton distribution functions (PDFs) of first-generation quarks. The enhanced
PDFs boost the production cross sections of LQs, particularly their single and
indirect productions. Incorporating all production modes of LQs that result in
a pair of RHNs, we estimate the discovery prospects by analysing the
monoelectron and dielectron channels arising from the decay of the RHN pair. We
find that the indirect production of LQs is crucial in determining the
discovery reach at the HL-LHC for the first-generation scenario.",2024-12-27T17:20:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19751v1,"Gokul Duraikandan, Rishabh Khanna, Tanumoy Mandal, Subhadip Mitra, Rachit Sharma"
"IMAGINE: An 8-to-1b 22nm FD-SOI Compute-In-Memory CNN Accelerator With
  an End-to-End Analog Charge-Based 0.15-8POPS/W Macro Featuring
  Distribution-Aware Data Reshaping","Charge-domain compute-in-memory (CIM) SRAMs have recently become an enticing
compromise between computing efficiency and accuracy to process sub-8b
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at the edge. Yet, they commonly make use
of a fixed dot-product (DP) voltage swing, which leads to a loss in effective
ADC bits due to data-dependent clipping or truncation effects that waste
precious conversion energy and computing accuracy. To overcome this, we present
IMAGINE, a workload-adaptive 1-to-8b CIM-CNN accelerator in 22nm FD-SOI. It
introduces a 1152x256 end-to-end charge-based macro with a multi-bit DP based
on an input-serial, weight-parallel accumulation that avoids power-hungry DACs.
An adaptive swing is achieved by combining a channel-wise DP array split with a
linear in-ADC implementation of analog batch-normalization (ABN), obtaining a
distribution-aware data reshaping. Critical design constraints are relaxed by
including the post-silicon equivalent noise within a CIM-aware CNN training
framework. Measurement results showcase an 8b system-level energy efficiency of
40TOPS/W at 0.3/0.6V, with competitive accuracies on MNIST and CIFAR-10.
Moreover, the peak energy and area efficiencies of the 187kB/mm2 macro
respectively reach up to 0.15-8POPS/W and 2.6-154TOPS/mm2, scaling with the
8-to-1b computing precision. These results exceed previous charge-based designs

Flavor Physics at CEPC: a General Perspective,"We discuss the landscape of flavor physics at the Circular Electron-Positron
Collider (CEPC), based on the nominal luminosity outlined in its Technical
Design Report. The CEPC is designed to operate in multiple modes to address a
variety of tasks. At the $Z$ pole, the expected production of 4 Tera $Z$ bosons
will provide unique and highly precise measurements of $Z$ boson couplings,
while the substantial number of boosted heavy-flavored quarks and leptons
produced in clean $Z$ decays will facilitate investigations into their flavor
physics with unprecedented precision. We investigate the prospects of measuring
various physics benchmarks and discuss their implications for particle theories
and phenomenological models. Our studies indicate that, with its highlighted
advantages and anticipated excellent detector performance, the CEPC can explore
beauty and $\tau$ physics in ways that are superior to or complementary with
the Belle II and Large-Hadron-Collider-beauty experiments, potentially enabling
the detection of new physics at energy scales of 10 TeV and above. This
potential also extends to the observation of yet-to-be-discovered rare and
exotic processes, as well as testing fundamental principles such as lepton
flavor universality, lepton and baryon number conservation, etc., making the
CEPC a vibrant platform for flavor physics research. The $WW$ threshold scan,
Higgs-factory operation and top-pair productions of the CEPC further enhance
its merits in this regard, especially for measuring the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements, and Flavor-Changing-Neutral-Current

"Weak lumping of left-invariant random walks on left cosets of finite
  groups","Let $G$ be a finite group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. The
left-invariant random walk driven by a probability measure $w$ on $G$ is the
Markov chain in which from any state $x \in G$, the probability of stepping to
$xg \in G$ is $w(g)$. The initial state is chosen randomly according to a given
distribution. The walk is said to lump weakly on left cosets if the induced
process on $G/H$ is a time-homogeneous Markov chain. We characterise all the
initial distributions and weights $w$ such that the walk is irreducible and
lumps weakly on left cosets, and determine all the possible transition matrices
of the induced Markov chain. In the case where $H$ is abelian we refine our
main results to give a necessary and sufficient condition for weak lumping by
an explicit system of linear equations on $w$, organized by the double cosets
$HxH$. As an application we consider shuffles of a deck of $n$ cards such that
repeated observations of the top card form a Markov chain. Such shuffles
include the random-to-top shuffle, and also, when the deck is started in a
uniform random order, the top-to-random shuffle. We give a further family of
examples in which our full theory of weak lumping is needed to verify that the

reconstruction of spin ordering. Various interactions are taken into account:
surface interaction different from the bulk one, competing interactions,
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Surface phase transitions are shown in some
particularly striking cases. Finally, some cases of topological spin textures

"On dual-projectively equivalent connections associated to second order

on a Riemannian manifold are curves along which the $1$-forms associated to the
velocity are preserved after a reparametrization. Superintegrable systems are
Hamiltonian systems with a large number of independent constants of the motion.
They are said to be second order if the constants of the motion can be chosen
to be quadratic polynomials in the momenta. Famous examples include the
Kepler-Coulomb and the harmonic oscillator systems, which are foundational

"Periodically and aperiodically Thue-Morse driven long-range systems:
  from dynamical localization to slow dynamics","We investigate the electric-field driven power-law random banded
matrix(PLRBM) model where a variation in the power-law exponent $\alpha$ yields
a delocalization-to-localization phase transition. We examine the periodically
driven PLRBM model with the help of the Floquet operator. The level spacing
ratio and the generalized participation ratio of the Floquet Hamiltonian reveal
a drive-induced fractal phase accompanied by diffusive transport on the
delocalized side of the undriven PLRBM model. On the localized side, the
time-periodic model remains localized - the average spacing ratio corresponds
to Poisson statistics and logarithmic transport is observed in the dynamics.
Extending our analysis to the aperiodic Thue-Morse (TM) driven system, we find
that the aperiodically driven clean long-range hopping model (clean counterpart
of the PLRBM model) exhibits the phenomenon of \textit{exact dynamical
localization} (EDL) on tuning the drive-parameters at special points. The
disordered time-aperiodic system shows diffusive transport followed by
relaxation to the infinite-temperature state on the delocalized side, and a
prethermal plateau with subdiffusion on the localized side. Additionally, we
compare this with a quasi-periodically driven AAH model that also undergoes a
localization-delocalization transition. Unlike the disordered long-range model,
it features a prolonged prethermal plateau followed by subdiffusion to the
infinite temperature state, even on the delocalized side.",2024-12-27T16:55:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19736v1,"Vatsana Tiwari, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Auditya Sharma"

"Dynamics, data and reconstruction","Data-driven learning is prevalent in many fields of science, mathematics and
engineering. The goal of data-driven learning of dynamical systems is to
interpret timeseries as a continuous observation of an underlying dynamical
system. This task is not well-posed for a variety of reasons. A dynamical
system may have multiple sub-systems co-existing within it. The nature of the
dataset depends on the portion of the phase space being viewed, and may thus my
confined to a sub-system. Secondly these sub-systems may be topologically
inter-weaved, so may be inseparable computationally. Thirdly, two timeseries
sampled separately from different dynamical systems may be close or even
indistinguishable. So there is no unqiue source for the timeseries. We show how
these ambiguities are circumvented if one considers dynamical systems and
measurement maps collectively. This is made possible in a category theoretical
framework, in which reconstruction is unique up to equivalences. We introduce
two categories of observed dynamical systems and timeseries-data. These are
related to the well known category of dynamical systems via functors. This
enables a functorial interpretation of the task of reconstruction as well.",2024-12-27T16:49:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19734v1,"Suddhasattwa Das, Tomoharu Suda"

High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications,"Permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with

  We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d

two-dimensional setting -- the theory to prove convergence of sequences of
(random) $d$-dimensional permutations to (random) $d$-dimensional permutons.
  Building on this new theory, we determine the random high-dimensional
permuton limits for two natural families of high-dimensional permutations.
First, we determine the $3$-dimensional permuton limit for Schnyder wood
permutations, which bijectively encode planar triangulations decorated by
triples of spanning trees known as Schnyder woods. Second, we identify the
$d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a
pattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary
separable permutations.
  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously
studied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable
permutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections

Can Large Language Models Adapt to Other Agents In-Context?,"As the research community aims to build better AI assistants that are more
dynamic and personalized to the diversity of humans that they interact with,
there is increased interest in evaluating the theory of mind capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). Indeed, several recent studies suggest that LLM
theory of mind capabilities are quite impressive, approximating human-level
performance. Our paper aims to rebuke this narrative and argues instead that
past studies were not directly measuring agent performance, potentially leading
to findings that are illusory in nature as a result. We draw a strong
distinction between what we call literal theory of mind i.e. measuring the
agent's ability to predict the behavior of others and functional theory of mind
i.e. adapting to agents in-context based on a rational response to predictions
of their behavior. We find that top performing open source LLMs may display
strong capabilities in literal theory of mind, depending on how they are
prompted, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even when
partner policies are exceedingly simple. Our work serves to highlight the
double sided nature of inductive bias in LLMs when adapting to new situations.

We first process the far-field data to obtain a post-processed data set within

low-rank space given by the low-rank structure. The unknown is approximately
solved in this low-rank space, by dropping higher-order terms. The low-rank

"OS-Genesis: Automating GUI Agent Trajectory Construction via Reverse
  Task Synthesis","Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their
utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists:
collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for
collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation
through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or
unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited
data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world
environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI
data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection
process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents
first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then
retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level
exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality

"Quantum correlations in a gravitational collapse simulation with
  SpheriCo.jl","We report on work using a newly developed code, SpheriCo.jl, that computes
the gravitational collapse of a spherical scalar field, where the scalar can be
either a classical field, or a quantum field operator. By utilising
summation-by-parts methods for the numerical derivatives we are able to
simulate the collapse longer than was possible previously due to enhanced
numerical stability. We present a suite of tests for the code that tests its
accuracy and stability, both for the classical and quantum fields. We are able
to observe critical behavior of gravitational collapse for the classical setup,
in agreement with expected results. The code is also used to compute two-point
correlation functions, with results that hint at a non-trivial correlation
across the horizon of Hawking quanta.",2024-12-27T16:20:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19722v1,"Benjamin Berczi, Magdalena Eriksson, Thanasis Giannakopoulos, Paul M. Saffin"
Sharpening Neural Implicit Functions with Frequency Consolidation Priors,"Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) are vital implicit representations to
represent high fidelity 3D surfaces. Current methods mainly leverage a neural
network to learn an SDF from various supervisions including signed distances,
3D point clouds, or multi-view images. However, due to various reasons
including the bias of neural network on low frequency content, 3D unaware
sampling, sparsity in point clouds, or low resolutions of images, neural
implicit representations still struggle to represent geometries with high
frequency components like sharp structures, especially for the ones learned
from images or point clouds. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a method
to sharpen a low frequency SDF observation by recovering its high frequency
components, pursuing a sharper and more complete surface. Our key idea is to
learn a mapping from a low frequency observation to a full frequency coverage
in a data-driven manner, leading to a prior knowledge of shape consolidation in
the frequency domain, dubbed frequency consolidation priors. To better
generalize a learned prior to unseen shapes, we introduce to represent
frequency components as embeddings and disentangle the embedding of the low
frequency component from the embedding of the full frequency component. This
disentanglement allows the prior to generalize on an unseen low frequency
observation by simply recovering its full frequency embedding through a
test-time self-reconstruction. Our evaluations under widely used benchmarks or
real scenes show that our method can recover high frequency component and
produce more accurate surfaces than the latest methods. The code, data, and
pre-trained models are available at \url{https://github.com/chenchao15/FCP}.",2024-12-27T16:18:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19720v1,"Chao Chen, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han"
"Trading Off Energy Storage and Payload -- An Analytical Model for
  Freight Train Configuration","To support planning of alternative fuel technology (e.g., battery-electric
locomotives) deployment for decarbonizing non-electrified freight rail, we
develop a convex optimization formulation with a closed-form solution to
determine the optimal number of energy storage tender cars in a train. The
formulation shares a similar structure to an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
model. For given market characteristics, cost forecasts, and technology
parameters, our model captures the trade-offs between inventory carrying costs
associated with trip times (including delays due to charging/refueling) and
ordering costs associated with train dispatch and operation (energy, amortized
equipment, and labor costs). To illustrate the framework, we find the optimal
number of battery-electric energy tender cars in 22,501 freight markets
(origin-destination pairs and commodities) for U.S. Class I railroads. The
results display heterogeneity in optimal configurations with lighter, yet more
time-sensitive shipments (e.g., intermodal) utilizing more battery tender cars.
For heavier commodities (e.g., coal) with lower holding costs, single battery
tender car configurations are generally optimal. The results also show that the
optimal train configurations are sensitive to delays associated with recharging
or swapping tender cars.",2024-12-27T16:18:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19719v1,"Max T. M. Ng, Adrian Hernandez, Pablo L. Durango-Cohen, Hani S. Mahmassani"
"Text2Insight: Transform natural language text into insights seamlessly
  using multi-model architecture","The growing demand for dynamic, user-centric data analysis and visualization
is evident across domains like healthcare, finance, and research. Traditional
visualization tools often fail to meet individual user needs due to their
static and predefined nature. To address this gap, Text2Insight is introduced
as an innovative solution that delivers customized data analysis and
visualizations based on user-defined natural language requirements. Leveraging
a multi-model architecture, Text2Insight transforms user inputs into actionable
insights and dynamic visualizations.
  The methodology begins with analyzing the input dataset to extract structural
details such as columns and values. A pre-trained Llama3 model converts the
user's natural language query into an SQL query, which is further refined using
a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for accuracy. A chart predictor
determines the most suitable visualization type, while the Llama3 model
generates insights based on the SQL query's results. The output is a
user-friendly and visually informative chart. To enhance analysis capabilities,
the system integrates a question-answering model and a predictive model using
the BERT framework. These models provide insights into historical data and
predict future trends.
  Performance evaluation of Text2Insight demonstrates its effectiveness,
achieving high accuracy (99%), precision (100%), recall (99%), and F1-score
(99%), with a BLEU score of 0.5. The question-answering model attained an
accuracy of 89% and the predictive model achieved 70% accuracy. These results
validate Text2Insight as a robust and viable solution for transforming natural
language text into dynamic, user-specific data analysis and visualizations.",2024-12-27T16:17:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19718v1,Pradeep Sain
"The non-standad logic of physics: the case of the Boltzmann-Sinai
  hard-sphere system","One of the most challenging and fascinating issues in mathematical and
theoretical physics concerns identifying the common logic, if any, which
underlies the physical world. More precisely, this involves the search of the
possibly-unique axiomatic logical proposition calculus to apply simultaneously
both to classical and quantum realms of physics and to be consistent with the
corresponding mathematical and filosophysical setups. Based on the recent
establishment of quantum logic, which has been shown to apply both to Quantum
Mechanics and Quantum Gravity, the crucial remaining step involves the
identification of the appropriate axiomatic logical proposition calculus to be
associated with Classical Mechanics. In this paper the issue is posed for a
fundamental example of Classical Mechanics, which is represented by the
so-called Boltzmann-Sinai dynamical system. This is realized by the ensemble of
classical smooth hard-spheres, which is set at the basis of Classical
Statistical Mechanics and is also commonly regarded as a possible realization
of Classical Newtonian Cosmology. Depending on the initial conditions which are
prescribed for such a system, its classical state is shown to obey the
propositional calculus of non-classical logic. In particular, the latter is
expressed by the 3-way Principle of Non-Contradiction, namely the same logical
principle that holds for quantum logic. The result therefore permits to
question on a mathematical basis the principles of deterministic classical
logic and the validity of their character within the domain of Classical
Physics. Such a conclusion represents a potential notable innovation in the
logical dicotomy true/false, a crucial topic which has crossed millennia
through philosophy, logic, mathematics and physics.",2024-12-27T16:15:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19716v1,"Massimo Tessarotto, Claudio Cremaschini, Claudio Asci, Alessandro Soranzo, Marco Tessarotto, Gino Tironi"
Entanglement-Driven Energy Exchange in a Two-Qubit Quantum Battery,"This study investigates the dynamics of quantum batteries (QBs), focusing on
the pivotal role of quantum entanglement in mediating inter-cellular energy
transfer within a two-cell configuration (two-qubit), wherein one cell is
directly coupled to the charging source. Employing the Lindblad master equation
to model the system's evolution, the influence of coherent state amplitudes,
detuning, inter-cellular coupling strength, and dissipation rates on stored
energy, energy fluctuations, concurrence-quantified entanglement, and their
parametric interrelations is scrutinized. Our results indicate a direct
correlation between the degree of entanglement and energy transfer efficiency
between the qubits. Specifically, the stronger the entanglement between primary
cell, which is connected to the charger, and secondary cell, the more
effectively energy is transferred. This demonstrates that enhanced entanglement
significantly facilitates energy transfer between the two qubits.",2024-12-27T16:15:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19715v1,"Ahmed A. Zahia, M. Y. Abd-Rabbou, Ahmed M. Megahed"
"From Elements to Design: A Layered Approach for Automatic Graphic Design
  Composition","In this work, we investigate automatic design composition from multimodal
graphic elements. Although recent studies have developed various generative
models for graphic design, they usually face the following limitations: they
only focus on certain subtasks and are far from achieving the design
composition task; they do not consider the hierarchical information of graphic
designs during the generation process. To tackle these issues, we introduce the
layered design principle into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and propose a
novel approach, called LaDeCo, to accomplish this challenging task.
Specifically, LaDeCo first performs layer planning for a given element set,
dividing the input elements into different semantic layers according to their
contents. Based on the planning results, it subsequently predicts element
attributes that control the design composition in a layer-wise manner, and
includes the rendered image of previously generated layers into the context.
With this insightful design, LaDeCo decomposes the difficult task into smaller
manageable steps, making the generation process smoother and clearer. The
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaDeCo in design
composition. Furthermore, we show that LaDeCo enables some interesting
applications in graphic design, such as resolution adjustment, element filling,
design variation, etc. In addition, it even outperforms the specialized models
in some design subtasks without any task-specific training.",2024-12-27T16:13:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19712v1,"Jiawei Lin, Shizhao Sun, Danqing Huang, Ting Liu, Ji Li, Jiang Bian"
"All Finite (Anti)Hermitian Irreducible Representations of the de Sitter
  and Anti-de Sitter Lie Algebras and Their Lorentz Structure","Because of the importance of unitarity in quantum physics, work on the
representations of the de Sitter group has focussed on the unitary case, which
necessarily means infinite dimensional matrices for this non-compact group.
Here we address the finite dimensional representations resulting from the
requirement that the Lie algebra generators are either Hermitian or
anti-Hermitian. The complete classification of all such irreducible
representations is found and their matrix elements specified. These irreducible
representations (irreps) are based on backbones defined as the homogeneous
Lorentz sub-algebra and consisting of direct sums of the finite irreps of the
homogeneous Lorentz algebra (HLA). Only two types of such backbones arise (see
5.1a,b herein). Consequently, only certain dimensions of representation are
possible, namely 4, 5, 10, 14, 20, 30, 35, 55, 56, 91, etc or generally either
1/6 N(N+1)(N+2) or 1/6 N(N+1)(2N+1) where N=2,3,4,etc is the number of HLA
irreps in the backbone (minimum 2). The two Casimir invariants can be specified
in terms of a single integral or half-integral parameter, p. For irreps based
on (5.1a), -C1=p(p+1)-2 and C2=0 with p taking values 2,3,4,etc. For irreps
based on (5.1b), -C1=2(p^2-1) and -C2= p^2 (p^2-1) with p taking values
3/2,2,5/2,3,etc. These correspond to the same expressions found for the unitary
representations, -C1=p(p+1)+(q+1)(q-2) and -C2=p(p+1)q(q-1) with q=0 and q=p
respectively for the two types of irrep. There is thus a far more restricted
set of finite irreps with Hermitian or anti-Hermitian generators than for the
discrete infinite dimensional unitary irreps. The corresponding irreps of the
anti-de Sitter group follow immediately from the replacement of the 4-momentum
operators from V to iV.",2024-12-27T16:02:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19708v1,Richard A. W. Bradford
"Noise Sensitivity of the Semidefinite Programs for Direct Data-Driven
  LQR","In this paper, we study the noise sensitivity of the semidefinite program
(SDP) proposed for direct data-driven infinite-horizon linear quadratic
regulator (LQR) problem for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. While
this SDP is shown to find the true LQR controller in the noise-free setting, we
show that it leads to a trivial solution with zero gain matrices when data is
corrupted by noise, even when the noise is arbitrarily small. We then study a
variant of the SDP that includes a robustness promoting regularization term and
prove that regularization does not fully eliminate the sensitivity issue. In
particular, the solution of the regularized SDP converges in probability also
to a trivial solution.",2024-12-27T15:59:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19705v1,"Xiong Zeng, Laurent Bako, Necmiye Ozay"
"Reparameterization Invariance of FRW Model: Supervariable and BRST
  Approaches","We perform the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization of a (0 +
1)-dimensional non-interacting cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
model. This quantization leverages the classical infinitesimal and continuous
reparameterization symmetry transformations of the system. To derive the
nilpotent reparameterization invariant (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for
the scale factor and corresponding momentum variables of the FRW model, we
employ the modified Bonora-Tonin supervariable approach (MBTSA) to BRST
formalism. Through this approach, we also establish the (anti-)BRST invariant
Curci-Ferrari (CF)-type restriction for this cosmological reparameterization
invariant model. Further, we obtain the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry
transformations for other variables within the model using the (anti-)chiral
supervariable approach (ACSA) to BRST formalism. Within the framework of ACSA,
the CF-type restriction is demonstrated through two key aspects: (i) the
invariance of the coupled Lagrangians under symmetry transformations, and (ii)
the absolute anticommutativity of the conserved (anti-)BRST charges. Notably,
applying the MBTSA to a physical cosmological system, specifically a
one-dimensional one, constitutes a novel contribution to this work.
Additionally, in the application of ACSA, we restrict our analysis to
(anti-)chiral super expansions of supervariables, leading to the unique
observation of the absolute anticommutativity of the (anti-)BRST charges.
Moreover, we highlight that the CF-type restriction demonstrates a universal
nature, remaining consistent across any reparameterization invariant models in
D-dimensional spacetime.",2024-12-27T15:58:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19704v1,"B. Chauhan, R. Tripathi"

condition (IC) having a nontrivial background of amplitude $q_o&gt;0$ as $x\to \pm

solved numerically by means of appropriate contour deformations in the complex
plane following the numerical implementation of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear
steepest descent method. In this work, the box parameters are chosen so that
there is no discrete spectrum (i.e., no solitons). In particular, the numerical
method is demonstrated to be accurate within the two asymptotic regimes
corresponding to two different regions of the $(x,t)$-plane depending on
whether $|x/(2t)| &lt; q_o$ or $|x/(2t)| &gt; q_o$, as $t \to \infty$.",2024-12-27T15:57:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19703v1,"Aikaterini Gkogkou, Barbara Prinari, Thomas Trogdon"

Continuous majorization in quantum phase space with Wigner negativity,"Different variants of partial orders among quantum states arise naturally in
the context of various quantum resources. For example, in discrete variable
quantum computation, stabilizer operations naturally produce an order between
input and output states; in technical terms this order is vector majorization
of discrete Wigner functions in discrete phase space. The order results in
inequalities for magic monotones. In the continuous variable case, a natural
counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum
phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly
restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum
7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization
in the general $N$-mode case. In particular, we propose extensions to include
states with finite Wigner negativity. Among our results, we prove a conjecture
made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf for the convex hull of $N$-mode
Gaussian states, and a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of
majorization.",2024-12-27T15:51:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698v1,"Jan de Boer, Giuseppe Di Giulio, Esko Keski-Vakkuri, Erik Tonni"
Differentiable groupoid objects and their abstract Lie algebroids,"The infinitesimal counterpart of a Lie groupoid is its Lie algebroid. As a
vector bundle, it is given by the source vertical tangent bundle restricted to
the identity bisection. Its sections can be identified with the invariant
vector fields on the groupoid, which are closed under the Lie bracket. We
generalize this differentiation procedure to groupoid objects in any category
with an abstract tangent structure in the sense of Rosick\'{y} and a scalar
multiplication by a ring object that plays the role of the real numbers. We
identify the categorical conditions that the groupoid object must satisfy to
admit a natural notion of invariant vector fields. Then we show that invariant
vector fields are closed under the Lie bracket defined by Rosick\'{y} and
satisfy the Leibniz rule with respect to ring-valued morphisms on the base of
the groupoid. The result is what we define axiomatically as an abstract Lie
algebroid, by generalizing the underlying vector bundle to a module object in
the slice category over its base. Examples include diffeomorphism groups,
bisection groups of Lie groupoids, the diffeological symmetry groupoids of
general relativity (Blohmann/Fernandes/Weinstein), symmetry groupoids in
Lagrangian Field Theory, holonomy groupoids of singular foliations, elastic
diffeological groupoids, and groupoid objects in differentiable stacks.",2024-12-27T15:50:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19697v1,"Lory Aintablian, Christian Blohmann"

study develops a robust artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline aimed at
predicting live birth outcomes in IVF treatments. The pipeline uses anonymized

classifiers including random forest (RF) and decision tree, as well as deep
learning-based classifiers including custom transformer-based model and a tab
transformer model with an attention mechanism. Our research demonstrated that
the best performance was achieved by combining PSO for feature selection with
the TabTransformer-based deep learning model, yielding an accuracy of 99.50%

"Nonperturbative effects in triple-differential dijet and Z+jet
  production at the LHC","In comparisons of precision collider data to the most accurate highest-order
calculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD), it is required to
correct for nonperturbative effects. Such effects are typically studied using
Monte Carlo event generators that complement fixed-order predictions with
perturbative parton showers and models for the nonperturbative effects of the
Underlying Event and hadronisation. Thereby, the final state of collision
events can be predicted at the level of stable particles, which serve as input
for full detector simulations.
  This article investigates the impact of nonperturbative effects on two
processes that may be used for precision determinations of the strong coupling
constant and the proton structure: the triple-differential dijet and Z+jet
production. While nonperturbative effects impact both processes, significant
differences among them are observed and further investigated. Indications are
found that the Underlying Event and hadronisation cannot fully explain these

"Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly,
  and Symmetric Mass Generation","Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T)
symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana
and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential
fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed
point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this
work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all
spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the
fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum
many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the
fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we
demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG,
which shows consistency with known results from K\""ahler-Dirac fermion or
cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial
dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of
staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion
interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry
constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground

"A Review on the Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Medical
  Imaging in IVF Ovarian Stimulation","Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance
decision-making and optimize treatment protocols in in vitro fertilization
(IVF). In particular, AI shows significant promise in supporting
decision-making during the ovarian stimulation phase of the IVF process. This
review evaluates studies focused on the applications of AI combined with
medical imaging in ovarian stimulation, examining methodologies, outcomes, and
current limitations. Our analysis of 13 studies on this topic reveals that,
reveal that while AI algorithms demonstrated notable potential in predicting
optimal hormonal dosages, trigger timing, and oocyte retrieval outcomes, the
medical imaging data utilized predominantly came from two-dimensional (2D)
ultrasound which mainly involved basic quantifications, such as follicle size
and number, with limited use of direct feature extraction or advanced image
analysis techniques. This points to an underexplored opportunity where advanced
image analysis approaches, such as deep learning, and more diverse imaging
modalities, like three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, could unlock deeper
insights. Additionally, the lack of explainable AI (XAI) in most studies raises
concerns about the transparency and traceability of AI-driven decisions - key
factors for clinical adoption and trust. Furthermore, many studies relied on
single-center designs and small datasets, which limit the generalizability of
their findings. This review highlights the need for integrating advanced
imaging analysis techniques with explainable AI methodologies, as well as the
importance of leveraging multicenter collaborations and larger datasets.

"A Large-scale Interpretable Multi-modality Benchmark for Facial Image
  Forgery Localization","Image forgery localization, which centers on identifying tampered pixels
within an image, has seen significant advancements. Traditional approaches
often model this challenge as a variant of image segmentation, treating the
binary segmentation of forged areas as the end product. We argue that the basic
binary forgery mask is inadequate for explaining model predictions. It doesn't
clarify why the model pinpoints certain areas and treats all forged pixels the
same, making it hard to spot the most fake-looking parts. In this study, we
mitigate the aforementioned limitations by generating salient region-focused
interpretation for the forgery images. To support this, we craft a Multi-Modal
Tramper Tracing (MMTT) dataset, comprising facial images manipulated using
deepfake techniques and paired with manual, interpretable textual annotations.
To harvest high-quality annotation, annotators are instructed to meticulously
observe the manipulated images and articulate the typical characteristics of
the forgery regions. Subsequently, we collect a dataset of 128,303 image-text
pairs. Leveraging the MMTT dataset, we develop ForgeryTalker, an architecture
designed for concurrent forgery localization and interpretation. ForgeryTalker
first trains a forgery prompter network to identify the pivotal clues within
the explanatory text. Subsequently, the region prompter is incorporated into
multimodal large language model for finetuning to achieve the dual goals of
localization and interpretation. Extensive experiments conducted on the MMTT
dataset verify the superior performance of our proposed model. The dataset,

"Boosting Private Domain Understanding of Efficient MLLMs: A Tuning-free,
  Adaptive, Universal Prompt Optimization Framework","Efficient multimodal large language models (EMLLMs), in contrast to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), reduce model size and computational
costs and are often deployed on resource-constrained devices. However, due to
data privacy concerns, existing open-source EMLLMs rarely have access to
private domain-specific data during the pre-training process, making them
difficult to directly apply in device-specific domains, such as certain
business scenarios. To address this weakness, this paper focuses on the
efficient adaptation of EMLLMs to private domains, specifically in two areas:
1) how to reduce data requirements, and 2) how to avoid parameter fine-tuning.
Specifically, we propose a tun\textbf{\underline{I}}ng-free,
a\textbf{\underline{D}}aptiv\textbf{\underline{E}},

Framework, abbreviated as \textit{\textbf{\ourmethod{}}} which consists of two
stages: 1) Predefined Prompt, based on the reinforcement searching strategy,
generate a prompt optimization strategy tree to acquire optimization priors; 2)
Prompt Reflection initializes the prompt based on optimization priors, followed
by self-reflection to further search and refine the prompt. By doing so,
\ourmethod{} elegantly generates the ``ideal prompts'' for processing private
domain-specific data. Note that our method requires no parameter fine-tuning
and only a small amount of data to quickly adapt to the data distribution of
private data. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that our
proposed \ourmethod{} significantly improves both efficiency and performance

"Combining Machine Learning with Recurrence Analysis for resonance
  detection","The width of a resonance in a nearly integrable system, i.e. in a
non-integrable system where chaotic motion is still not prominent, can tell us
how a perturbation parameter is driving the system away from integrability.
Although the tool that we are presenting here can be used is quite generic and
can be used in a variety of systems, our particular interest lies in binary
compact object systems known as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In an
EMRI a lighter compact object, like a black hole or a neutron star, inspirals
into a supermassive black hole due to gravitational radiation reaction. During
this inspiral the lighter object crosses resonances, which are still not very
well modeled. Measuring the width of resonances in EMRI models allows us to
estimate the importance of each perturbation parameter able to drive the system
away from resonances and decide whether its impact should be included in EMRI
waveform modeling or not. To tackle this issue in our study we show first that
recurrence quantifiers of orbits carry imprints of resonant behavior,
regardless of the system's dimensionality. As a next step, we apply a long
short-term memory machine learning architecture to automate the resonance
detection procedure. Our analysis is developed on a simple standard map and
gradually we extend it to more complicated systems until finally we employ it

identifying and localising plant disease based on the Quad-Tree decomposition
of an image and feature learning simultaneously. The proposed algorithm
significantly improves accuracy and faster convergence in high-resolution
images with relatively low computational load. Hence it is ideal for deploying
the algorithm in a standalone processor in a remotely operated image
acquisition and disease detection system, ideally mounted on drones and robots
working on large agricultural fields. The technique proposed in this article is

Deep ReLU networks -- injectivity capacity upper bounds,"We study deep ReLU feed forward neural networks (NN) and their injectivity
abilities. The main focus is on \emph{precisely} determining the so-called
injectivity capacity. For any given hidden layers architecture, it is defined
as the minimal ratio between number of network's outputs and inputs which
ensures unique recoverability of the input from a realizable output. A strong
recent progress in precisely studying single ReLU layer injectivity properties
is here moved to a deep network level. In particular, we develop a program that
connects deep $l$-layer net injectivity to an $l$-extension of the $\ell_0$
spherical perceptrons, thereby massively generalizing an isomorphism between
studying single layer injectivity and the capacity of the so-called
(1-extension) $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons discussed in [82]. \emph{Random
duality theory} (RDT) based machinery is then created and utilized to
statistically handle properties of the extended $\ell_0$ spherical perceptrons
and implicitly of the deep ReLU NNs. A sizeable set of numerical evaluations is
conducted as well to put the entire RDT machinery in practical use. From these
we observe a rapidly decreasing tendency in needed layers' expansions, i.e., we
observe a rapid \emph{expansion saturation effect}. Only $4$ layers of depth
are sufficient to closely approach level of no needed expansion -- a result
that fairly closely resembles observations made in practical experiments and
that has so far remained completely untouchable by any of the existing

"Optimizing Local-Global Dependencies for Accurate 3D Human Pose
  Estimation","Transformer-based methods have recently achieved significant success in 3D
human pose estimation, owing to their strong ability to model long-range
dependencies. However, relying solely on the global attention mechanism is
insufficient for capturing the fine-grained local details, which are crucial
for accurate pose estimation. To address this, we propose SSR-STF, a
dual-stream model that effectively integrates local features with global
dependencies to enhance 3D human pose estimation. Specifically, we introduce
SSRFormer, a simple yet effective module that employs the skeleton selective
refine attention (SSRA) mechanism to capture fine-grained local dependencies in
human pose sequences, complementing the global dependencies modeled by the
Transformer. By adaptively fusing these two feature streams, SSR-STF can better
learn the underlying structure of human poses, overcoming the limitations of
traditional methods in local feature extraction. Extensive experiments on the
Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that SSR-STF achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with P1 errors of 37.4 mm and 13.2 mm
respectively, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and
generalization. Furthermore, the motion representations learned by our model

mapping random points to the target space. To tackle the first issue, we
utilize a similarity learning network that maps sampled points into a
representation space. In this space, in-target points are grouped together
while out-target points are effectively pushed apart. This approach enhances
the scan convergence by refining the representation of sampled points. The
second challenge is mitigated by integrating a dynamic sampling strategy.
Specifically, we employ a VEGAS mapping to adaptively suggest new points for
the DL network while also improving the mapping when more points are collected.

bosons. As with particle interferometers, in an extended collider there is an
infinite number of trajectories for any single or multi-particle event.
Self-interference of the former can lead to an apparent bunching of fermions

Port-Hamiltonian nonlinear systems,"Control theory often takes the mathematical model of the to-be-control-led
system for granted. In contrast, port-Hamiltonian systems theory bridges the
gap between modelling and control for physical systems. It provides a unified
framework for the modelling of complex multiphysics systems. At the same time
it offers powerful tools for analysis and control by identifying the underlying
physical structure, as reflected in, e.g., energy balance and other conserved
quantities. This leads to control schemes that \emph{exploit} the physical
structure, instead of compensating for it. As a result, the derived control
laws tend to be simple, physically interpretable, and robust with respect to
physical parameter variations.
  In this paper, after introducing port-Hamiltonian systems, the focus is on
'control by interconnection' for set-point stabilization of nonlinear physical
systems. Most of this theory is well-established, but novel developments using

Spectral form factors for curved spacetimes with horizon,"The spectral form factor is believed to provide a special type of behavior
called ""dip-ramp-plateau"" in chaotic quantum systems which originates from the
random matrix theory. A similar behavior could be observed for deterministic
systems, ranging from the Riemann zeta function to the scattering amplitudes of
different types. It has been shown recently, the same behavior is observed for
the spectral form factor when the normal modes of a scalar massless field
theory in the brickwall model of the BTZ black hole are substituted as
eigenvalues of some quantum Hamiltonian. At the same time, the level spacing
distribution of these eigenvalues differs from that associated with the random
matrix theory ensembles. In this paper, we generalize these results considering
the recently proposed generalized spectral form factor for the de Sitter and
BTZ spacetimes. We study the details of this complex-valued form factor for
integrable quantum systems and for backgrounds with a horizon comparing it with
the random matrix theory behavior. As a result, we confirm that the scalar

"Toward Scalable Multirobot Control: Fast Policy Learning in Distributed
  MPC","Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) is promising in achieving optimal
cooperative control in multirobot systems (MRS). However, real-time DMPC
implementation relies on numerical optimization tools to periodically calculate
local control sequences online. This process is computationally demanding and
lacks scalability for large-scale, nonlinear MRS. This article proposes a novel
distributed learning-based predictive control (DLPC) framework for scalable
multirobot control. Unlike conventional DMPC methods that calculate open-loop
control sequences, our approach centers around a computationally fast and
efficient distributed policy learning algorithm that generates explicit
closed-loop DMPC policies for MRS without using numerical solvers. The policy
learning is executed incrementally and forward in time in each prediction
interval through an online distributed actor-critic implementation. The control
policies are successively updated in a receding-horizon manner, enabling fast
and efficient policy learning with the closed-loop stability guarantee. The
learned control policies could be deployed online to MRS with varying robot
scales, enhancing scalability and transferability for large-scale MRS.
Furthermore, we extend our methodology to address the multirobot safe learning
challenge through a force field-inspired policy learning approach. We validate
our approach's effectiveness, scalability, and efficiency through extensive
experiments on cooperative tasks of large-scale wheeled robots and multirotor
drones. Our results demonstrate the rapid learning and deployment of DMPC

Engineering Digital Systems for Humanity: a Research Roadmap,"As testified by new regulations like the European AI Act, worries about the
human and societal impact of (autonomous) software technologies are becoming of
public concern. Human, societal, and environmental values, alongside
traditional software quality, are increasingly recognized as essential for
sustainability and long-term well-being. Traditionally, systems are engineered
taking into account business goals and technology drivers. Considering the
growing awareness in the community, in this paper, we argue that engineering of
systems should also consider human, societal, and environmental drivers. Then,
we identify the macro and technological challenges by focusing on humans and
their role while co-existing with digital systems. The first challenge
considers humans in a proactive role when interacting with digital systems,
i.e., taking initiative in making things happen instead of reacting to events.
The second concerns humans having a reactive role in interacting with digital
systems, i.e., humans interacting with digital systems as a reaction to events.
The third challenge focuses on humans with a passive role, i.e., they
experience, enjoy or even suffer the decisions and/or actions of digital
systems. The fourth challenge concerns the duality of trust and
trustworthiness, with humans playing any role. Building on the new human,
societal, and environmental drivers and the macro and technological challenges,

characterising the gravitational field. In this paper, we review the
construction of the Geroch--Hansen multipole moments for stationary
asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes. A particular focus is placed on the
well-definedness of these moments, which hinges on the uniqueness of the
one-point conformal completion in Geroch's asymptotic flatness definition.
Based on Geroch's approach, we formulate and prove a revised uniqueness result,
thereby filling in some gaps in the original approach. Uniqueness holds up to
certain conformal transformations, and we discuss how the multipole moments
behave under such transformations.",2024-12-27T14:27:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19667v1,Jorn van Voorthuizen
"Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$α$ and H$β$ active
  galactic nuclei using radius--luminosity relations involving monochromatic
  and broad H$α$ luminosities","We test the standardizability of a homogeneous sample of 41 lower-redshift
($0.00415\leq z \leq 0.474$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reverberation-mapped
(RM) using the broad H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines. We find that these
sources can be standardized using four radius$-$luminosity ($R-L$) relations
incorporating H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ time delays and monochromatic and broad
H$\alpha$ luminosities. Although the $R-L$ relation parameters are well
constrained and independent of the six cosmological models considered, the
resulting cosmological constraints are weak. The measured $R-L$ relations
exhibit slightly steeper slopes than predicted by a simple photoionization
model and steeper than those from previous higher-redshift H$\beta$ analyses
based on larger datasets. These differences likely reflect the absence of
high-accreting sources in our smaller, lower-redshift sample, which primarily
comprises lower-accreting AGNs. The inferred cosmological parameters are
consistent within 2$\sigma$ (or better) with those from better-established
cosmological probes. This contrasts with our earlier findings using a larger,
heterogeneous sample of 118 H$\beta$ AGNs, which yielded cosmological
constraints differing by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ from better-established cosmological
probes. Our analysis demonstrates that sample homogeneity$-$specifically, the
use of a consistent time-lag determination method$-$is crucial for developing
RM AGNs as a cosmological probe.",2024-12-27T14:23:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19665v1,"Shulei Cao, Amit Kumar Mandal, Michal Zajaček, Bożena Czerny, Bharat Ratra"
The Value of Recall in Extensive-Form Games,"Imperfect-recall games, in which players may forget previously acquired
information, have found many practical applications, ranging from game
abstractions to team games and testing AI agents. In this paper, we quantify
the utility gain by endowing a player with perfect recall, which we call the
value of recall (VoR). While VoR can be unbounded in general, we parameterize
it in terms of various game properties, namely the structure of chance nodes
and the degree of absentmindedness (the number of successive times a player
enters the same information set). Further, we identify several pathologies that
arise with VoR, and show how to circumvent them. We also study the complexity
of computing VoR, and how to optimally apportion partial recall. Finally, we
connect VoR to other previously studied concepts in game theory, including the
price of anarchy. We use that connection in conjunction with the celebrated
smoothness framework to characterize VoR in a broad class of games.",2024-12-27T14:12:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19659v1,"Ratip Emin Berker, Emanuel Tewolde, Ioannis Anagnostides, Tuomas Sandholm, Vincent Conitzer"

category symmetry and features a tensor product Hilbert space. The construction
begins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the
Haagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is
equivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry
topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum
double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show
that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve
the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state,
which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying

"FreStega: A Plug-and-Play Method for Boosting Imperceptibility and
  Capacity in Generative Linguistic Steganography for Real-World Scenarios","Linguistic steganography embeds secret information in seemingly innocent
texts, safeguarding privacy in surveillance environments. Generative linguistic
steganography leverages the probability distribution of language models (LMs)
and applies steganographic algorithms to generate stego tokens, gaining
attention with recent Large Language Model (LLM) advancements. To enhance
security, researchers develop distribution-preserving stego algorithms to
minimize the gap between stego sampling and LM sampling. However, the reliance
on language model distributions, coupled with deviations from real-world cover
texts, results in insufficient imperceptibility when facing steganalysis
detectors in real-world scenarios. Moreover, LLM distributions tend to be more
deterministic, resulting in reduced entropy and, consequently, lower embedding
capacity. In this paper, we propose FreStega, a plug-and-play method to
reconstruct the distribution of language models used for generative linguistic
steganography. FreStega dynamically adjusts token probabilities from the
language model at each step of stegotext auto-regressive generation, leveraging
both sequential and spatial dimensions. In sequential adjustment, the
temperature is dynamically adjusted based on instantaneous entropy, enhancing
the diversity of stego texts and boosting embedding capacity. In the spatial
dimension, the distribution is aligned with guidance from the target domain
corpus, closely mimicking real cover text in the target domain. By reforming
the distribution, FreStega enhances the imperceptibility of stego text in
practical scenarios and improves steganographic capacity by 15.41\%, all
without compromising the quality of the generated text. FreStega serves as a
plug-and-play remedy to enhance the imperceptibility and embedding capacity of
existing distribution-preserving steganography methods in real-world scenarios.",2024-12-27T13:56:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19652v1,Kaiyi Pang

"VideoMaker: Zero-shot Customized Video Generation with the Inherent
  Force of Video Diffusion Models","Zero-shot customized video generation has gained significant attention due to
its substantial application potential. Existing methods rely on additional
models to extract and inject reference subject features, assuming that the
Video Diffusion Model (VDM) alone is insufficient for zero-shot customized
video generation. However, these methods often struggle to maintain consistent
subject appearance due to suboptimal feature extraction and injection
techniques. In this paper, we reveal that VDM inherently possesses the force to
extract and inject subject features. Departing from previous heuristic
approaches, we introduce a novel framework that leverages VDM's inherent force
to enable high-quality zero-shot customized video generation. Specifically, for
feature extraction, we directly input reference images into VDM and use its
intrinsic feature extraction process, which not only provides fine-grained
features but also significantly aligns with VDM's pre-trained knowledge. For
feature injection, we devise an innovative bidirectional interaction between
subject features and generated content through spatial self-attention within
VDM, ensuring that VDM has better subject fidelity while maintaining the
diversity of the generated video.Experiments on both customized human and

Global thermodynamics for isothermal fluids under gravity,"We develop a formulation of global thermodynamics for equilibrium systems
under the influence of gravity. The free energy for simple fluids is extended
to include a dependence on $(T, V, N, mgL)$, where $L$ represents the vertical
system length in the direction of gravity. A central idea in this formulation
is to uniquely fix the reference point of the gravitational potential, ensuring
a consistent thermodynamic framework. Using this framework, we derive the
probability density of thermodynamic quantities, which allows us to define a
variational function for determining equilibrium liquid-gas coexistence under
gravity. The resulting free energy landscape, derived from the variational
function, reveals the local stability of liquid-gas configurations.
Specifically, the liquid phase resides at the lower portion of the system due
to gravity, while the inverted configuration (with liquid on top) is also
locally stable in this landscape. Furthermore, we characterize the transition
between these liquid-gas configurations as a first-order phase transition using
the thermodynamic free energy of $(T,V,N,mgL)$. Finally, we validate the
predictions of global thermodynamics through molecular dynamics simulations,
demonstrating the applicability and accuracy of the proposed framework.",2024-12-27T13:47:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19643v1,"Naoko Nakagawa, Shin-ichi Sasa, Takamichi Hirao, Tsuyoshi Shiina, Kyosuke Tachi, Akira Yoshida"

ReNeg: Learning Negative Embedding with Reward Guidance,"In text-to-image (T2I) generation applications, negative embeddings have
proven to be a simple yet effective approach for enhancing generation quality.
Typically, these negative embeddings are derived from user-defined negative
prompts, which, while being functional, are not necessarily optimal. In this
paper, we introduce ReNeg, an end-to-end method designed to learn improved
Negative embeddings guided by a Reward model. We employ a reward feedback
learning framework and integrate classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the
training process, which was previously utilized only during inference, thus
enabling the effective learning of negative embeddings. We also propose two
strategies for learning both global and per-sample negative embeddings.
Extensive experiments show that the learned negative embedding significantly
outperforms null-text and handcrafted counterparts, achieving substantial
improvements in human preference alignment. Additionally, the negative
embedding learned within the same text embedding space exhibits strong
generalization capabilities. For example, using the same CLIP text encoder, the
negative embedding learned on SD1.5 can be seamlessly transferred to
text-to-image or even text-to-video models such as ControlNet, ZeroScope, and

we present a Black Phosphorus/Graphitic Carbon Nitride (BP/g-CN)
heterostructure engineered to leverage phosphorus-nitrogen interactions for
enhanced electrochemical glucose oxidation activity. Compared to pristine gCN,
the BP-gCN heterostructure demonstrates a significantly improved
electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and nearly two-fold reduction in charge
transfer resistance (Rct), achieving remarkable glucose sensitivity of 1.1 uA

"Primordial Black Hole Formation from the Upward Step Model: Avoiding
  Overproduction","We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in an upward
step inflationary model, where nonlinearities between curvature perturbations

This necessitates a reevaluation of PBH formation, as $\mathcal{R}$ is not the
optimal variable for estimating abundance. Using the extended Press-Schechter
formalism, we show that non-Gaussianity modifies both the curvature
perturbation profile $\mathcal{R}(r)$ and the integration path in probability
space, significantly impacting PBH abundance. Our results reveal that the
abundance initially increases with the parameter $h$, which characterizes the
relaxation stage after the step. However, beyond a critical value ($h \simeq
5.9$), it sharply declines before rising again. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that non-Gaussianity introduces uncertainties in indirect PBH observations via
gravitational waves. Notably, we present an example where a positive $f_{\rm
NL}$ does not necessarily enhance PBH production, contrary to conventional
expectations. Finally, by accounting for non-perturbative effects, we resolve

"An unholy trinity: TFNP, polynomial systems, and the quantum

one is promised an efficiently verifiable proof exists for a problem, finding
this proof can be intractable. Despite the success of the theory at showing
intractability of problems such as computing Brouwer fixed points and Nash
equilibria, subclasses of TFNP remain arguably few and far between. In this
work, we define two new subclasses of TFNP borne of the study of complex
polynomial systems: Multi-homogeneous Systems (MHS) and Sparse Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra (SFTA). The first of these is based on B\'ezout's theorem

the first TFNP problem whose classical variant (SAT with SDR) is easy but whose
quantum variant is hard. We also show how to embed the roots of a sparse,

"Bidding Games on Markov Decision Processes with Quantitative
  Reachability Objectives","Graph games are fundamental in strategic reasoning of multi-agent systems and
their environments. We study a new family of graph games which combine
stochastic environmental uncertainties and auction-based interactions among the
agents, formalized as bidding games on (finite) Markov decision processes
(MDP). Normally, on MDPs, a single decision-maker chooses a sequence of
actions, producing a probability distribution over infinite paths. In bidding
games on MDPs, two players -- called the reachability and safety players -- bid
for the privilege of choosing the next action at each step. The reachability
player's goal is to maximize the probability of reaching a target vertex,
whereas the safety player's goal is to minimize it. These games generalize
traditional bidding games on graphs, and the existing analysis techniques do
not extend. For instance, the central property of traditional bidding games is
the existence of a threshold budget, which is a necessary and sufficient budget
to guarantee winning for the reachability player. For MDPs, the threshold
becomes a relation between the budgets and probabilities of reaching the
target. We devise value-iteration algorithms that approximate thresholds and
optimal policies for general MDPs, and compute the exact solutions for acyclic
MDPs, and show that finding thresholds is at least as hard as solving
simple-stochastic games.",2024-12-27T12:10:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19609v1,"Guy Avni, Martin Kurečka, Kaushik Mallik, Petr Novotný, Suman Sadhukhan"

"Enhancing Fine-grained Image Classification through Attentive Batch
  Training","Fine-grained image classification, which is a challenging task in computer
vision, requires precise differentiation among visually similar object
categories. In this paper, we propose 1) a novel module called Residual
Relationship Attention (RRA) that leverages the relationships between images
within each training batch to effectively integrate visual feature vectors of
batch images and 2) a novel technique called Relationship Position Encoding
(RPE), which encodes the positions of relationships between original images in
a batch and effectively preserves the relationship information between images
within the batch. Additionally, we design a novel framework, namely
Relationship Batch Integration (RBI), which utilizes RRA in conjunction with
RPE, allowing the discernment of vital visual features that may remain elusive
when examining a singular image representative of a particular class. Through
extensive experiments, our proposed method demonstrates significant
improvements in the accuracy of different fine-grained classifiers, with an
average increase of $(+2.78\%)$ and $(+3.83\%)$ on the CUB200-2011 and Stanford
Dog datasets, respectively, while achieving a state-of-the-art results
$(95.79\%)$ on the Stanford Dog dataset. Despite not achieving the same level
of improvement as in fine-grained image classification, our method still
demonstrates its prowess in leveraging general image classification by
attaining a state-of-the-art result of $(93.71\%)$ on the Tiny-Imagenet
dataset. Furthermore, our method serves as a plug-in refinement module and can
be easily integrated into different networks.",2024-12-27T12:07:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19606v1,"Duy M. Le, Bao Q. Bui, Anh Tran, Cong Tran, Cuong Pham"

"Let Watermarks Speak: A Robust and Unforgeable Watermark for Language
  Models","Watermarking is an effective way to trace model-generated content. Current
watermark methods cannot resist forgery attacks, such as a deceptive claim that
the model-generated content is a response to a fabricated prompt. None of them
can be made unforgeable without degrading robustness.
  Unforgeability demands that the watermarked output is not only detectable but
also verifiable for integrity, indicating whether it has been modified. This
underscores the necessity and significance of a multi-bit watermarking scheme.
  Recent works try to build multi-bit scheme based on existing zero-bit
watermarking scheme, but they either degrades the robustness or brings a
significant computational burden. We aim to design a novel single-bit watermark
scheme, which provides the ability to embed 2 different watermark signals.
  This paper's main contribution is that we are the first to propose an
undetectable, robust, single-bit watermarking scheme. It has a comparable
robustness to the most advanced zero-bit watermarking schemes. Then we
construct a multi-bit watermarking scheme to use the hash value of prompt or
the newest generated content as the watermark signals, and embed them into the
following content, which guarantees the unforgeability.
  Additionally, we provide sufficient experiments on some popular language
models, while the other advanced methods with provable guarantees do not often
provide. The results show that our method is practically effective and robust.",2024-12-27T11:58:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19603v1,Minhao Bai

promising approach in quantum computing for determining the ground state of
physical systems. However, this approach requires not only the
$\textit{existence}$ of an environment that allows the system to dissipate

characteristics to be $\textit{known}$ in detail. In this paper, we propose an

environment's details may remain $\textit{unknown}$. The proposed algorithm is
Super-bath Quantum Eigensolver, which solves the system's ground state by
utilizing quasi-steady state preparation and simulating the coupling between
the system and the super-bath. Supported by experimental lifetime data of

Composite nature of the $T_{cc}$ state,"In 2021, LHCb collaboration reported a very narrow state in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$

"Theoretical Investigation of (Zn, Co) co-Doped BaTiO3 for Advanced

for lead-free barium titanate (BTO) -based materials that exhibit remarkable

ascertain the extent of performance enhancement and the underlying mechanism of

(Zn,Co) into the BaTiO3 lattice significantly augments the tetragonality of the
unit cell. Moreover, the ferroelectric properties are enhanced, with a
spontaneous polarization stronger than that observed in pure BTO, exhibiting
excellent ferroelectricity. The results of the Hubbard+U algorithm indicate
that the band gap of BZCT is reduced. Concurrently, the enhanced ferroelectric
polarization increases the built-in electric field of the material,
facilitating the separation of photogenerated carriers and improving optical

vital for drug discovery. Recently, deep learning methods have emerged as a
significant approach for estimating the binding strength between drugs and

Additionally, the features of drugs and proteins are usually fused with a
simple concatenation operation, limiting their effectiveness. To address these
challenges, we proposed ViDTA, an enhanced DTA prediction framework. We
introduce virtual nodes into the Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based drug feature
extraction network, which acts as a global memory to exchange messages more

Hybrid Population Monte Carlo,"Importance sampling (IS) is a powerful Monte Carlo (MC) technique for
approximating intractable integrals, for instance in Bayesian inference. The
performance of IS relies heavily on the appropriate choice of the so-called
proposal distribution. Adaptive IS (AIS) methods iteratively improve target
estimates by adapting the proposal distribution. Recent AIS research focuses on
enhancing proposal adaptation for high-dimensional problems, while addressing
the challenge of multi-modal targets. In this paper, a new class of AIS methods
is presented, utilizing a hybrid approach that incorporates weighted samples
and proposal distributions to enhance performance. This approach belongs to the
family of population Monte Carlo (PMC) algorithms, where a population of
proposals is adapted to better approximate the target distribution. The
proposed hybrid population Monte Carlo (HPMC) implements a novel two-step
adaptation mechanism. In the first step, a hybrid method is used to generate
the population of the preliminary proposal locations based on both weighted
samples and location parameters. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to
generate the preliminary proposal locations. HMC has a good exploratory
behavior, especially in high dimension scenarios. In the second step, the novel
cooperation algorithms are performing to find the final proposals for the next

undesired increase in power consumption with associated degradation and
stability concerns. Here, through detailed modeling of thermal transport and
carrier generation-recombination, we unravel the physical mechanisms that cause
luminescence droop under high injection conditions. We show that self-heating
leads to a reduction in the radiative recombination (both bimolecular and
excitonic). The resultant increase in non-radiative recombination and hence the
thermal dissipation acts as a positive feedback mechanism that leads to

Safe Interval Randomized Path Planing For Manipulators,"Planning safe paths in 3D workspace for high DoF robotic systems, such as
manipulators, is a challenging problem, especially when the environment is

Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect,"Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically
non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for
the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying
generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection
defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional
to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an
intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for
small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated
with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some
finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has
previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general
$p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a
consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial
coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$
fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of
intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge
theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon
gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$),
as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds
with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy)
spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification
and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as
artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly,
we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be
generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.",2024-12-27T10:09:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565v1,"Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calderón, Ashley M. Cook"
Stochastic resetting in a nonequilibrium environment,"This study examines the dynamics of a tracer particle diffusing in a
nonequilibrium medium under stochastic resetting. The nonequilibrium state is
induced by harmonic coupling between the tracer and bath particles, generating
memory effects with exponential decay in time. We explore the tracer's behavior
under a Poissonian resetting protocol, where resetting does not disturb the
bath environment, with a focus on key dynamical behavior and first-passage
properties, both in the presence and absence of an external force. The
interplay between coupling strength and diffusivity of bath particle
significantly impacts both the tracer's relaxation dynamics and search time,
with external forces further modulating these effects. Our analysis identifies
distinct hot and cold bath particles based on their diffusivities, revealing
that coupling to a hot particle facilitates the searching process, whereas
coupling to a cold particle hinders it. Using a combination of numerical
simulations and analytical methods, this study provides a comprehensive
framework for understanding resetting mechanisms in non-Markovian systems, with
potential applications to complex environments such as active and viscoelastic
media, where memory-driven dynamics and nonequilibrium interactions are

"Contrast-Optimized Basis Functions for Self-Navigated Motion Correction

artifacts more likely. For MR-Fingerprinting-like approaches, this problem can
be addressed with self-navigated retrospective motion correction based on
reconstructions in a singular value decomposition (SVD) subspace. However, the
SVD promotes high signal intensity in all tissues, which limits the contrast
between tissue types and ultimately reduces the accuracy of registration. The
purpose of this paper is to rotate the subspace for maximum contrast between
two types of tissue and improve the accuracy of motion estimates.
  Methods: A subspace is derived that promotes contrasts between brain
parenchyma and CSF, achieved through the generalized eigendecomposition of mean
autocorrelation matrices, followed by a Gram-Schmidt process to maintain
orthogonality. We tested our motion correction method on 85 scans with varying
motion levels, acquired with a 3D hybrid-state sequence optimized for
quantitative magnetization transfer imaging.

Quantiles under ambiguity and risk sharing,"Choquet capacities and integrals are central concepts in decision making

probabilities to capacities. Choquet quantiles share many features with
probabilistic quantiles, in terms of axiomatic representation, optimization
formulas, and risk sharing. We characterize Choquet quantiles via only one
axiom, called ordinality. We prove that the inf-convolution of Choquet
quantiles is again a Choquet quantile, leading to explicit optimal allocations

"Enhancing Media Literacy: The Effectiveness of (Human) Annotations and
  Bias Visualizations on Bias Detection","Marking biased texts is a practical approach to increase media bias awareness
among news consumers. However, little is known about the generalizability of
such awareness to new topics or unmarked news articles, and the role of
machine-generated bias labels in enhancing awareness remains unclear. This
study tests how news consumers may be trained and pre-bunked to detect media
bias with bias labels obtained from different sources ( (Human or AI) and in
various manifestations. We conducted two experiments with 470 and 846
participants, exposing them to various bias-labeling conditions. We
subsequently tested how much bias they could identify in unlabeled news
materials on new topics. The results show that both Human (t(467) = 4.55, p &lt;
.001, d = 0.42) and AI labels (t(467) = 2.49, p = .039, d = 0.23) increased
correct detection compared to the control group. Human labels demonstrate
larger effect sizes and higher statistical significance. The control group
(t(467) = 4.51, p &lt; .001, d = 0.21) also improves performance through mere
exposure to study materials. We also find that participants trained with marked
biased phrases detected bias most reliably (F(834,1) = 44.00, p &lt; .001,
{\eta}2part = 0.048). Our experimental framework provides theoretical
implications for systematically assessing the generalizability of learning
effects in identifying media bias. These findings also provide practical

"TARGA: Targeted Synthetic Data Generation for Practical Reasoning over
  Structured Data","Semantic parsing, which converts natural language questions into logic forms,
plays a crucial role in reasoning within structured environments. However,
existing methods encounter two significant challenges: reliance on extensive
manually annotated datasets and limited generalization capability to unseen
examples. To tackle these issues, we propose Targeted Synthetic Data Generation
(TARGA), a practical framework that dynamically generates high-relevance
synthetic data without manual annotation. Starting from the pertinent entities
and relations of a given question, we probe for the potential relevant queries
through layer-wise expansion and cross-layer combination. Then we generate
corresponding natural language questions for these constructed queries to
jointly serve as the synthetic demonstrations for in-context learning.
Experiments on multiple knowledge base question answering (KBQA) datasets
demonstrate that TARGA, using only a 7B-parameter model, substantially
outperforms existing non-fine-tuned methods that utilize close-sourced model,
achieving notable improvements in F1 scores on GrailQA(+7.7) and
KBQA-Agent(+12.2). Furthermore, TARGA also exhibits superior sample efficiency,

Diverse Rare Sample Generation with Pretrained GANs,"Deep generative models are proficient in generating realistic data but
struggle with producing rare samples in low density regions due to their
scarcity of training datasets and the mode collapse problem. While recent
methods aim to improve the fidelity of generated samples, they often reduce
diversity and coverage by ignoring rare and novel samples. This study proposes
a novel approach for generating diverse rare samples from high-resolution image
datasets with pretrained GANs. Our method employs gradient-based optimization
of latent vectors within a multi-objective framework and utilizes normalizing
flows for density estimation on the feature space. This enables the generation
of diverse rare images, with controllable parameters for rarity, diversity, and
similarity to a reference image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach both qualitatively and quantitatively across various datasets and GANs

detecting HOIs from videos, which is crucial for activity understanding.
However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the
truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide
limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world
benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted

object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover
interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have
succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare
objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision
systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging
spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D

PDE systems has been proposed to eliminate the analytical difficulties caused
by the integrals for the one-dimensional space. In this paper we establish a
PDE system approximation for the spatial convolutions in higher spatial
dimensions. We derive an approximation function for given arbitrary radial
integral kernels by linear sums of the Green functions. In the proof of this
methodology we introduce an appropriate integral transformation to show the
completeness of the basis constructed by the Green functions. From this theory,
it is possible to approximate the nonlocal operator of the convolution type

"Scalable Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Hyper Scale Multi-Robot
  Task Planning","To improve the efficiency of warehousing system and meet huge customer
orders, we aim to solve the challenges of dimension disaster and dynamic
properties in hyper scale multi-robot task planning (MRTP) for robotic mobile
fulfillment system (RMFS). Existing research indicates that hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) is an effective method to reduce these challenges.
Based on that, we construct an efficient multi-stage HRL-based multi-robot task
planner for hyper scale MRTP in RMFS, and the planning process is represented
with a special temporal graph topology. To ensure optimality, the planner is
designed with a centralized architecture, but it also brings the challenges of
scaling up and generalization that require policies to maintain performance for
various unlearned scales and maps. To tackle these difficulties, we first
construct a hierarchical temporal attention network (HTAN) to ensure basic
ability of handling inputs with unfixed lengths, and then design multi-stage
curricula for hierarchical policy learning to further improve the scaling up
and generalization ability while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
Additionally, we notice that policies with hierarchical structure suffer from
unfair credit assignment that is similar to that in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, inspired of which, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning
algorithm with counterfactual rollout baseline to improve learning performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that our planner outperform other
state-of-the-art methods on various MRTP instances in both simulated and
real-world RMFS. Also, our planner can successfully scale up to hyper scale
MRTP instances in RMFS with up to 200 robots and 1000 retrieval racks on
unlearned maps while keeping superior performance over other methods.",2024-12-27T09:07:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19538v1,"Xuan Zhou, Xiang Shi, Lele Zhang, Chen Chen, Hongbo Li, Lin Ma, Fang Deng, Jie Chen"
"Potential Vector Fields in $\mathbb R^3$ and $α$-Meridional
  Mappings of the Second Kind $(α\in \mathbb R)$","This paper extends approach developed in a recent author's paper on analytic
models of potential fields in inhomogeneous media. New three-dimensional
analytic models of potential vector fields in some layered media are
constructed. Properties of various analytic models in Cartesian and cylindrical

Jacobian matrix $\mathbf{J}(\vec V)$ of potential meridional fields $\vec V$ in
cylindrically layered media, where $\phi( \rho) = \rho^{-\alpha}$ $(\alpha \in

minimal cost label (e.g., points) to generate subject-driven images. During
fine-tuning, it can generate an expanded base mask from these points, obviating
the need for additional segmentation models. The mask is employed for
inpainting and aligning with subject representation. The P3S-Diffusion
preserves fine features of the subjects through Multi-layers Condition
Injection. Enhanced by the Attention Consistency Loss for improved training,

fine-tuning. (2) VLMs confidence scores serve as reliable indicators for
detecting and characterizing noise-related patterns in the data distribution.
(3) even subtle variations in caption fidelity have significant effects on the
quality of learned representations. These findings collectively emphasize the
profound impact of caption quality on model performance and highlight the need

cost-efficient methods for the accurate conversion of digital number values
acquired from a multispectral imager into reflectance, leveraging real-time
solar spectra as references. To ensure consistent measurements of incident
light, an upward gimbal-mounted downwelling spectrometer was attached to the
UAV, and a sinusoidal model was developed to correct for solar position
variability. Using principal component analysis on the reference solar spectrum
for band selection, a multiple linear regression model with four sensitive

direct correction method. The root mean square error (RMSE) for reflectance
prediction improved by 86.1% compared to the empirical line method under
fluctuating cloudy conditions and by 59.6% compared to the downwelling light
sensor method averaged across different weather conditions. The RMSE was
calculated as 2.24% in a ground-based diurnal validation, and 2.03% in a UAV
campaign conducted at various times throughout a sunny day. Implementing the
4-Band MLR model enhanced the consistency of canopy reflectance within a

cases of high term probability uncertainty, using heuristic analyses and

"Estimation of System Parameters Including Repeated Cross-Sectional Data

natural or engineered systems. Traditionally, the parameters in DEs are
adjusted to fit data from system observations. However, in fields such as

accurately estimate DE parameters when RCS data exhibit various
heterogeneities, leading to a significant loss of information. To address this

integrates a physics-informed neural network-based emulator that immediately
generates DE solutions and a Wasserstein generative adversarial network-based
parameter generator that can effectively mimic the RCS data. We evaluated EIDGM
on exponential growth, logistic population models, and the Lorenz system,
demonstrating its superior ability to accurately capture parameter
distributions. Additionally, we applied EIDGM to an experimental dataset of

displacement, local time, residence time, and area under the trajectory. Using
a backward Fokker-Planck approach, we derive the large deviation functions of
these observables, and demonstrate how singularities emerge from a competition
between survival and diffusion. Furthermore, we analyse this scenario using an
alternative approach with tilted operators, showing that at the singular point,
the effective dynamics undergoes an abrupt transition. Extending this approach,
we show that similar transitions may generically arise in Markov chains with

with another metric for overall self-correction capability evaluation. Based on
our decomposition and evaluation metrics, we conduct extensive experiments and
draw some empirical conclusions. For example, we find different models can
exhibit distinct behaviors: some models are confident while others are more
critical. We also find the trade-off between the two capabilities (i.e.
improving one can lead to a decline in the other) when manipulating model
self-correction behavior by prompts or in-context learning. Further, we find a
simple yet efficient strategy to improve self-correction capability by
transforming Supervision Fine-Tuning (SFT) data format, and our strategy
outperforms vanilla SFT in both capabilities and achieves much higher accuracy
after self-correction. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.",2024-12-27T08:09:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19513v1,"Zhe Yang, Yichang Zhang, Yudong Wang, Ziyao Xu, Junyang Lin, Zhifang Sui"
"Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning for Deep Learning-Based Full-Waveform
  Inversion","Seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) has seen promising advancements through
deep learning. Existing approaches typically focus on task-specific models
trained and evaluated in isolation that lead to limited generalization across
different geological scenarios. In this work we introduce a task-agnostic
foundational model for FWI that captures general features across tasks. We
first demonstrate that full fine-tuning of this foundational model outperforms
task-specific models built from scratch by delivering superior performance
across multiple benchmarks. Building upon this we employ parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) to further reduce computational overhead. By fine-tuning
only a small fraction of the model parameters PEFT achieves comparable results
to full fine-tuning while significantly lowering memory and computational
requirements. Additionally, PEFT excels in out-of-distribution tasks where it
outperforms both full fine-tuning and task-specific models. These findings
establish the value of foundational modeling for FWI and highlight PEFT as an
effective strategy for efficient and scalable adaptation across diverse tasks.",2024-12-27T08:00:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19510v1,"Koustav Ghosal, Abhranta Panigrahi, Arnav Chavan, ArunSingh, Deepak Gupta"
A Theoretical Study of Cavity-modulated Topological Anderson Insulators,"Strong light-matter interaction has been demonstrated feasible for
controlling phases of matter. In this work, the interplay with disorder is
studied and rich phenomena are demonstrated. Specifically, the topological
phases of the disordered longer-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model coupled

modify the hopping amplitudes, resulting in the change of phase transition
boundaries, and disorder induced topological Anderson insulating (TAI) phases
even in the presence of cavity photons. The critical disorder strength at the

"DrivingWorld: ConstructingWorld Model for Autonomous Driving via Video
  GPT","Recent successes in autoregressive (AR) generation models, such as the GPT
series in natural language processing, have motivated efforts to replicate this
success in visual tasks. Some works attempt to extend this approach to
autonomous driving by building video-based world models capable of generating
realistic future video sequences and predicting ego states. However, prior
works tend to produce unsatisfactory results, as the classic GPT framework is
designed to handle 1D contextual information, such as text, and lacks the
inherent ability to model the spatial and temporal dynamics essential for video
generation. In this paper, we present DrivingWorld, a GPT-style world model for
autonomous driving, featuring several spatial-temporal fusion mechanisms. This
design enables effective modeling of both spatial and temporal dynamics,
facilitating high-fidelity, long-duration video generation. Specifically, we
propose a next-state prediction strategy to model temporal coherence between
consecutive frames and apply a next-token prediction strategy to capture
spatial information within each frame. To further enhance generalization
ability, we propose a novel masking strategy and reweighting strategy for token
prediction to mitigate long-term drifting issues and enable precise control.
Our work demonstrates the ability to produce high-fidelity and consistent video
clips of over 40 seconds in duration, which is over 2 times longer than
state-of-the-art driving world models. Experiments show that, in contrast to
prior works, our method achieves superior visual quality and significantly more

"Nonlinear valley Hall effect in a bilayer transition metal
  dichalcogenide","Valley-contrasting Hall transport conventionally relies on the inversion
symmetry breaking in two-dimensional systems, which greatly limits the
selection range of valley materials. In particular, while monolayer transition
metal dichalcogenides have been widely utilized as a well-known class of valley
materials in valleytronics, the centrosymmetric nature hinders the realization
of valley-contrasting properties in the bilayer counterparts. Here, taking
MoS$_{2}$ as an example, we discover valley-contrasting transport in bilayer
transition metal dichalcogenides by exploring nonlinear transport regime. Using
effective models and first-principles calculations, our work demonstrates that
nonvanishing nonlinear valley Hall conductivities emerge in a uniaxially
strained MoS$_{2}$ bilayer, owing to strain-induced band tilts of Dirac
fermions. With the aid of small spin-orbit-coupling induced band splittings,
the conduction bands generate much remarkable nonlinear valley Hall
conductivity. Moreover, the nonlinear conductivities are highly tunable through
modulating the strength and the direction of the strain, chemical potential,
and interlayer gap. Our findings not only expands material choices for
valleytronic applications, but also provides opportunities for designing
advanced electronic devices that leverage nonlinear valley transports.",2024-12-27T07:36:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19502v1,"Zhichao Zhou, Ruijing Fang, Zhen Zhang, Xiaoyu Wang, Jiayan Rong, Xiao Li"

exhibit reflective symmetry with respect to a central angle (axis) of symmetry.
Testing for symmetry in the underlying circular density from which these angles

"RobotDiffuse: Motion Planning for Redundant Manipulator based on

enhanced kinematic performance and versatility, making them suitable for
applications like manufacturing, surgical robotics, and human-robot
collaboration. However, motion planning for these manipulators is challenging
due to increased DOFs and complex, dynamic environments. While traditional
motion planning algorithms struggle with high-dimensional spaces, deep
learning-based methods often face instability and inefficiency in complex
tasks. This paper introduces RobotDiffuse, a diffusion model-based approach for
motion planning in redundant manipulators. By integrating physical constraints
with a point cloud encoder and replacing the U-Net structure with an
encoder-only transformer, RobotDiffuse improves the model's ability to capture
temporal dependencies and generate smoother, more coherent motion plans. We
validate the approach using a complex simulator, and release a new dataset with

various tasks but also face significant privacy risks, limiting their practical
applications. Current researches on privacy assessment for LVLMs is limited in
scope, with gaps in both assessment dimensions and privacy categories. To
bridge this gap, we propose Multi-P$^2$A, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating the privacy preservation capabilities of LVLMs in terms of privacy

"Two superconducting thin films systems with potential integration of
  different quantum functionalities","Quantum computation based on superconducting circuits utilizes
superconducting qubits with Josephson tunnel junctions. Engineering
high-coherence qubits requires materials optimization. In this work, we present
two superconducting thin film systems, grown on silicon (Si), and one obtained
from the other via annealing. Cobalt (Co) thin films grown on Si were found to
be superconducting [EPL 131 (2020) 47001]. These films also happen to be a
self-organised hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor (S/F/S)
structure. The S/F/S hybrids are important for superconducting $\pi$-qubits
[PRL 95 (2005) 097001] and in quantum information processing. Here we present
our results on the superconductivity of a hybrid Co film followed by the
superconductivity of a CoSi$_2$ film, which was prepared by annealing the Co
film. CoSi$_2$, with its $1/f$ noise about three orders of magnitude smaller
compared to the most commonly used superconductor aluminium (Al), is a
promising material for high-coherence qubits. The hybrid Co film revealed
superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ = 5 K and anisotropy in the upper
critical field between the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The anisotropy
was of the order of ratio of lateral dimensions to thickness of the
superconducting Co grains, suggesting a quasi-2D nature of superconductivity.
On the other hand, CoSi$_2$ film showed a $T_c$ of 900 mK. In the resistivity
vs. temperature curve, we observe a peak near $T_c$. Magnetic field scan as a
function of $T$ shows a monotonic increase in intensity of this peak with
temperature. The origin of the peak has been explained in terms of parallel
resistive model for the particular measurement configuration. Although our
CoSi$_2$ film contains grain boundaries, we observed a perpendicular critical

Towards Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, deep learning based methods have revolutionized remote sensing
image segmentation. However, these methods usually rely on a pre-defined
semantic class set, thus needing additional image annotation and model training
when adapting to new classes. More importantly, they are unable to segment
arbitrary semantic classes. In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Remote
Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation (OVRSISS), which aims to segment arbitrary
semantic classes in remote sensing images. To address the lack of OVRSISS
datasets, we develop LandDiscover50K, a comprehensive dataset of 51,846 images
covering 40 diverse semantic classes. In addition, we propose a novel framework
named GSNet that integrates domain priors from special remote sensing models
and versatile capabilities of general vision-language models. Technically,
GSNet consists of a Dual-Stream Image Encoder (DSIE), a Query-Guided Feature
Fusion (QGFF), and a Residual Information Preservation Decoder (RIPD). DSIE
first captures comprehensive features from both special models and general
models in dual streams. Then, with the guidance of variable vocabularies, QGFF
integrates specialist and generalist features, enabling them to complement each
other. Finally, RIPD is proposed to aggregate multi-source features for more
accurate mask predictions. Experiments show that our method outperforms other
methods by a large margin, and our proposed LandDiscover50K improves the
performance of OVRSISS methods. The proposed dataset and method will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/yecy749/GSNet.",2024-12-27T07:20:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19492v1,"Chengyang Ye, Yunzhi Zhuge, Pingping Zhang"

a user willingness-aware sales talk collection by leveraging the ecological

in real sales interactions. We created a dialogue environment that closely
resembles real-world scenarios to elicit natural user willingness, with
participants evaluating their willingness at the utterance level from multiple
perspectives. We analyzed the collected data to gain insights into practical

RAIN: Real-time Animation of Infinite Video Stream,"Live animation has gained immense popularity for enhancing online engagement,
yet achieving high-quality, real-time, and stable animation with diffusion
models remains challenging, especially on consumer-grade GPUs. Existing methods
struggle with generating long, consistent video streams efficiently, often
being limited by latency issues and degraded visual quality over extended
periods. In this paper, we introduce RAIN, a pipeline solution capable of
animating infinite video streams in real-time with low latency using a single
RTX 4090 GPU. The core idea of RAIN is to efficiently compute frame-token
attention across different noise levels and long time-intervals while
simultaneously denoising a significantly larger number of frame-tokens than
previous stream-based methods. This design allows RAIN to generate video frames
with much shorter latency and faster speed, while maintaining long-range
attention over extended video streams, resulting in enhanced continuity and
consistency. Consequently, a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned with RAIN in
just a few epochs can produce video streams in real-time and low latency
without much compromise in quality or consistency, up to infinite long. Despite
its advanced capabilities, the RAIN only introduces a few additional 1D
attention blocks, imposing minimal additional burden. Experiments in benchmark
datasets and generating super-long videos demonstrating that RAIN can animate
characters in real-time with much better quality, accuracy, and consistency
than competitors while costing less latency. All code and models will be made

"Block cross-interactive residual smoothing for Lanczos-type solvers for
  linear systems with multiple right-hand sides","Lanczos-type solvers for large sparse linear systems often exhibit large
oscillations in the residual norms. In finite precision arithmetic, large
oscillations increase the residual gap (the difference between the recursively
updated residual and the explicitly computed residual) and a loss of attainable
accuracy of the approximations. This issue is addressed using cross-interactive
residual smoothing (CIRS). This approach improves convergence behavior and
reduces the residual gap. Similar to how the standard Lanczos-type solvers have
been extended to global and block versions for solving systems with multiple
right-hand sides, CIRS can also be extended to these versions. While we have
developed a global CIRS scheme (Gl-CIRS) in our previous study [K. Aihara, A.
Imakura, and K. Morikuni, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 43 (2022),
pp.1308--1330], in this study, we propose a block version (Bl-CIRS).
Subsequently, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Bl-CIRS from various
perspectives, such as theoretical insights into the convergence behaviors of
the residual and approximation norms, numerical experiments on model problems,
and a detailed rounding error analysis for the residual gap. For Bl-CIRS,
orthonormalizing the columns of direction matrices is crucial in effectively
reducing the residual gap. This analysis also complements our previous study
and evaluates the residual gap of the block Lanczos-type solvers.",2024-12-27T07:08:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19488v1,"Kensuke Aihara, Akira Imakura, Keiichi Morikuni"
UniBrain: A Unified Model for Cross-Subject Brain Decoding,"Brain decoding aims to reconstruct original stimuli from fMRI signals,

these methods greatly limit the generalization of models and fail to capture
cross-subject commonalities. To address this, we present UniBrain, a unified

includes a group-based extractor to handle variable fMRI signal lengths, a
mutual assistance embedder to capture cross-subject commonalities, and a
bilevel feature alignment scheme for extracting subject-invariant features. We
validate our UniBrain on the brain decoding benchmark, achieving comparable
performance to current state-of-the-art subject-specific models with extremely

Comprehensive Bayesian Exploration of Froggatt-Nielsen Mechanism,"The Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism successfully explains the hierarchical
structure of fermion Yukawa couplings by introducing a U(1) flavor symmetry

charge assignments within the Standard Model, including both the quark and
lepton sectors, using Bayesian statistical analysis. The study explores
scenarios involving both the seesaw mechanism and dimension-five operators for
neutrino mass generation. A comprehensive parameter scan over FN charges
reveals a wide range of charge assignments consistent with observed fermion
masses and mixing angles. Interestingly, negative FN charges and significant
generational differences in charges are found to be viable, contrary to
conventional assumptions. The analysis also compares the seesaw mechanism and
dimension-five operator scenarios, finding no strong preference between them
for optimal charge assignments. Furthermore, predictions for the lightest
neutrino mass and effective Majorana mass relevant for neutrinoless double-beta
decay are presented, highlighting regions of parameter space accessible to
upcoming experiments. Finally, implications for nucleon decay are studied,
demonstrating that different FN charge assignments predict significantly

Learning Radiance Fields from a Single Snapshot Compressive Image,"In this paper, we explore the potential of Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI)
technique for recovering the underlying 3D scene structure from a single
temporal compressed image. SCI is a cost-effective method that enables the
recording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal
information, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve
this, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, reducing
storage and transmission requirements and offering potential privacy
protection. Inspired by this, we take one step further to recover the encoded
3D scene information leveraging powerful 3D scene representation capabilities
of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically, we propose SCINeRF, in which we
formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the training of NeRF,
allowing us to exploit its impressive performance in capturing complex scene

Generative Adversarial Network on Motion-Blur Image Restoration,"In everyday life, photographs taken with a camera often suffer from motion
blur due to hand vibrations or sudden movements. This phenomenon can
significantly detract from the quality of the images captured, making it an
interesting challenge to develop a deep learning model that utilizes the
principles of adversarial networks to restore clarity to these blurred pixels.
In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks

Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which
comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions.
This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to
produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation
metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to
evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and
mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in
this project. The blurry pixels are sharper in the output of GAN model shows a

"Exploiting Dynamic Sparsity for Near-Field Spatial Non-Stationary
  XL-MIMO Channel Tracking","This work considers a spatial non-stationary channel tracking problem in
broadband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO)
systems. In the case of spatial non-stationary, each scatterer has a certain
visibility region (VR) over antennas and power change may occur among visible
antennas. Concentrating on the temporal correlation of XL-MIMO channels, we
design a three-layer Markov prior model and hierarchical two-dimensional (2D)
Markov model to exploit the dynamic sparsity of sparse channel vectors and VRs,
respectively. Then, we formulate the channel tracking problem as a bilinear
measurement process, and a novel dynamic alternating maximum a posteriori
(DA-MAP) framework is developed to solve the problem. The DA-MAP contains four
basic modules: channel estimation module, VR detection module, grid update
module, and temporal correlated module. Specifically, the first module is an
inverse-free variational Bayesian inference (IF-VBI) estimator that avoids
computational intensive matrix inverse each iteration; the second module is a
turbo compressive sensing (Turbo-CS) algorithm that only needs small-scale

"Traversing Quantum Control Robustness Landscapes: A New Paradigm for
  Quantum Gate Engineering","The optimization of robust quantum control is often tailored to specific
tasks and suffers from inefficiencies due to the complexity of cost functions
that account for gate infidelity, noise susceptibility, and intricate
constraints. Our recent findings suggest a more efficient approach through the
engineering of quantum gates, beginning with any arbitrary robust control
configuration. We first introduce the Quantum Control Robustness Landscape
(QCRL), a conceptual framework that maps control parameters to noise
susceptibility. This framework facilitates a systematic investigation of
equally robust controls for diverse quantum operations. By navigating through
the level sets of the QCRL, our algorithm Robustness-Invariant Pulse Variation
allows for the variation of control pulses while preserving robustness.
Numerical simulations demonstrate that our single- and two-qubit gates exceed
the quantum error correction threshold even with substantial noise, thereby

"Quantum Transport through Asymmetrical Molecular channel Azulene: Role
  of Orbital Interference","We investigate electron transport through azulene molecule with four distinct
electrode contact geometries using the non-equilibrium Green's function
formalism within the tight-binding Hamiltonian. Employing the Q-matrix
approach, we analyze quantum interference (QI) among the molecular orbitals in
each contact configuration. Our results reveal distinct transmission profiles
and varying current responses among configurations, with the configuration 1-3
displaying the highest conductivity at higher bias due to strong constructive
interference of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO). Conversely,
configuration 5-7 exhibit weak conductance and antiresonance at the Fermi
energy, attributed to dominant destructive interference among the frontier
molecular orbitals. Configuration 2-6 is found to exhibit asymmetric I-V
characteristics, due to the dipolar nature of the azulene molecule. These
findings underscore the significance of QI effects in shaping the transport
properties of azulene, and molecule-based devices in general.",2024-12-27T05:56:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19472v1,"Koushik R. Das, Sudipta Dutta"
"Meta-Learning-Based Delayless Subband Adaptive Filter using Complex
  Self-Attention for Active Noise Control","Active noise control typically employs adaptive filtering to generate
secondary noise, where the least mean square algorithm is the most widely used.
However, traditional updating rules are linear and exhibit limited
effectiveness in addressing nonlinear environments and nonstationary noise. To
tackle this challenge, we reformulate the active noise control problem as a
meta-learning problem and propose a meta-learning-based delayless subband
adaptive filter with deep neural networks. The core idea is to utilize a neural
network as an adaptive algorithm that can adapt to different environments and
types of noise. The neural network will train under noisy observations,
implying that it recognizes the optimized updating rule without true labels. A
single-headed attention recurrent neural network is devised with learnable
feature embedding to update the adaptive filter weight efficiently, enabling
accurate computation of the secondary source to attenuate the unwanted primary
noise. In order to relax the time constraint on updating the adaptive filter
weights, the delayless subband architecture is employed, which will allow the
system to be updated less frequently as the downsampling factor increases. In
addition, the delayless subband architecture does not introduce additional time
delays in active noise control systems. A skip updating strategy is introduced
to decrease the updating frequency further so that machines with limited
resources have more possibility to board our meta-learning-based model.
Extensive multi-condition training ensures generalization and robustness
against various types of noise and environments. Simulation results demonstrate
that our meta-learning-based model achieves superior noise reduction
performance compared to traditional methods.",2024-12-27T05:51:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19471v1,"Pengxing Feng, Hing Cheung So"
Movable Antenna-Aided Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication,"Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is emerging as a pivotal
technology for next-generation wireless networks. However, existing ISAC
systems are based on fixed-position antennas (FPAs), which inevitably incur a
loss in performance when balancing the trade-off between sensing and
communication. Movable antenna (MA) technology offers promising potential to
enhance ISAC performance by enabling flexible antenna movement. Nevertheless,
exploiting more spatial channel variations requires larger antenna moving
regions, which may invalidate the conventional far-field assumption for
channels between transceivers. Therefore, this paper utilizes the MA to enhance
sensing and communication capabilities in near-field ISAC systems, where a
full-duplex base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit and receive
MAs movable in large-size regions to simultaneously sense multiple targets and
serve multiple uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) users for communication. We aim to
maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication rates (WSR) by jointly
designing the transmit beamformers, sensing signal covariance matrices, receive
beamformers, and MA positions at the BS, as well as the UL power allocation.
The resulting optimization problem is challenging to solve, while we propose an
efficient two-layer random position (RP) algorithm to tackle it. In addition,
to reduce movement delay and cost, we design an antenna position matching (APM)
algorithm based on the greedy strategy to minimize the total MA movement
distance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the substantial performance
improvement achieved by deploying MAs in near-field ISAC systems. Moreover, the
results show the effectiveness of the proposed APM algorithm in reducing the
antenna movement distance, which is helpful for energy saving and time overhead
reduction for MA-aided near-field ISAC systems with large moving regions.",2024-12-27T05:45:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19470v1,"Jingze Ding, Zijian Zhou, Xiaodan Shao, Bingli Jiao, Rui Zhang"
"Knowledge Graph-Based Multi-Agent Path Planning in Dynamic Environments
  using WAITR","This paper addresses the challenge of multi-agent path planning for efficient
data collection in dynamic, uncertain environments, exemplified by autonomous
underwater vehicles (AUVs) navigating the Gulf of Mexico. Traditional greedy
algorithms, though computationally efficient, often fall short in long-term
planning due to their short-sighted nature, missing crucial data collection
opportunities and increasing exposure to hazards. To address these limitations,
we introduce WAITR (Weighted Aggregate Inter-Temporal Reward), a novel
path-planning framework that integrates a knowledge graph with pathlet-based
planning, segmenting the environment into dynamic, speed-adjusted sub-regions
(pathlets). This structure enables coordinated, adaptive planning, as agents
can operate within time-bound regions while dynamically responding to
environmental changes. WAITR's cumulative scoring mechanism balances immediate
data collection with long-term optimization of Points of Interest (POIs),
ensuring safer navigation and comprehensive data coverage. Experimental results
show that WAITR substantially improves POI coverage and reduces exposure to
hazards, achieving up to 27.1\% greater event coverage than traditional greedy
methods.",2024-12-27T05:43:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19469v1,"Ted Edward Holmberg, Elias Ioup, Mahdi Abdelguerfi"
A Time Series Analysis of Assertions in the Linux Kernel,"Assertions are a classical and typical software development technique. These
are extensively used also in operating systems and their kernels, including the
Linux kernel. The paper patches a gap in existing knowledge by empirically
examining the longitudinal evolution of assertion use in the Linux kernel.
According to the results, the use of assertions that cause a kernel panic has
slightly but not substantially decreased from the kernel's third to the sixth
release series. At the same time, however, the use of softer assertion variants
has increased; these do not cause a panic by default but instead produce
warnings. With these time series results, the paper contributes to the existing
but limited empirical knowledge base about operating system kernels and their
long-term evolution.",2024-12-27T05:22:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19465v1,Jukka Ruohonen
"MNet-SAt: A Multiscale Network with Spatial-enhanced Attention for
  Segmentation of Polyps in Colonoscopy","Objective: To develop a novel deep learning framework for the automated
segmentation of colonic polyps in colonoscopy images, overcoming the
limitations of current approaches in preserving precise polyp boundaries,
incorporating multi-scale features, and modeling spatial dependencies that
accurately reflect the intricate and diverse morphology of polyps. Methods: To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiscale Network with
Spatial-enhanced Attention (MNet-SAt) for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy
images. This framework incorporates four key modules: Edge-Guided Feature
Enrichment (EGFE) preserves edge information for improved boundary quality;
Multi-Scale Feature Aggregator (MSFA) extracts and aggregates multi-scale
features across channel spatial dimensions, focusing on salient regions;
Spatial-Enhanced Attention (SEAt) captures spatial-aware global dependencies
within the multi-scale aggregated features, emphasizing the region of interest;
and Channel-Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CE-ASPP) resamples and
recalibrates attentive features across scales. Results: We evaluated MNet-SAt
on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, achieving Dice Similarity
Coefficients of 96.61% and 98.60%, respectively. Conclusion: Both quantitative
(DSC) and qualitative assessments highlight MNet-SAt's superior performance and
generalization capabilities compared to existing methods. Significance:
MNet-SAt's high accuracy in polyp segmentation holds promise for improving
clinical workflows in early polyp detection and more effective treatment,

Pulse-induced memory-like effect in cyclotron motion?,"We study how a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field along its
standard circular path (cyclotron motion) reacts to a short-duration,
homogeneous, uniform electric field pulse injected in the plane perpendicular
to the magnetic field. A `permanent' change in the radius of the initial circle
and a shift of its centre is noted at later times, after the pulse is switched
off. The magnitude of the velocity undergoes a change too, akin to a `velocity

similar features within a simple, non-relativistic context.",2024-12-27T05:13:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19460v1,Sayan Kar
"DriveEditor: A Unified 3D Information-Guided Framework for Controllable
  Object Editing in Driving Scenes","Vision-centric autonomous driving systems require diverse data for robust
training and evaluation, which can be augmented by manipulating object
positions and appearances within existing scene captures. While recent
advancements in diffusion models have shown promise in video editing, their
application to object manipulation in driving scenarios remains challenging due
to imprecise positional control and difficulties in preserving high-fidelity
object appearances. To address these challenges in position and appearance
control, we introduce DriveEditor, a diffusion-based framework for object
editing in driving videos. DriveEditor offers a unified framework for
comprehensive object editing operations, including repositioning, replacement,
deletion, and insertion. These diverse manipulations are all achieved through a
shared set of varying inputs, processed by identical position control and
appearance maintenance modules. The position control module projects the given
3D bounding box while preserving depth information and hierarchically injects
it into the diffusion process, enabling precise control over object position
and orientation. The appearance maintenance module preserves consistent
attributes with a single reference image by employing a three-tiered approach:
low-level detail preservation, high-level semantic maintenance, and the
integration of 3D priors from a novel view synthesis model. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
DriveEditor's exceptional fidelity and controllability in generating diverse
driving scene edits, as well as its remarkable ability to facilitate downstream
tasks.",2024-12-27T04:49:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19458v1,"Yiyuan Liang, Zhiying Yan, Liqun Chen, Jiahuan Zhou, Luxin Yan, Sheng Zhong, Xu Zou"
Focusing Image Generation to Mitigate Spurious Correlations,"Instance features in images exhibit spurious correlations with background
features, affecting the training process of deep neural classifiers. This leads
to insufficient attention to instance features by the classifier, resulting in
erroneous classification outcomes. In this paper, we propose a data
augmentation method called Spurious Correlations Guided Synthesis (SCGS) that
mitigates spurious correlations through image generation model. This approach
does not require expensive spurious attribute (group) labels for the training
data and can be widely applied to other debiasing methods. Specifically, SCGS
first identifies the incorrect attention regions of a pre-trained classifier on
the training images, and then uses an image generation model to generate new
training data based on these incorrect attended regions. SCGS increases the
diversity and scale of the dataset to reduce the impact of spurious
correlations on classifiers. Changes in the classifier's attention regions and
experimental results on three different domain datasets demonstrate that this
method is effective in reducing the classifier's reliance on spurious
correlations.",2024-12-27T04:48:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19457v1,"Xuewei Li, Zhenzhen Nie, Mei Yu, Zijian Zhang, Jie Gao, Tianyi Xu, Zhiqiang Liu"
"NijiGAN: Transform What You See into Anime with Contrastive
  Semi-Supervised Learning and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations","Generative AI has transformed the animation industry. Several models have
been developed for image-to-image translation, particularly focusing on
converting real-world images into anime through unpaired translation.
Scenimefy, a notable approach utilizing contrastive learning, achieves high
fidelity anime scene translation by addressing limited paired data through
semi-supervised training. However, it faces limitations due to its reliance on
paired data from a fine-tuned StyleGAN in the anime domain, often producing
low-quality datasets. Additionally, Scenimefy's high parameter architecture
presents opportunities for computational optimization. This research introduces
NijiGAN, a novel model incorporating Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
(NeuralODEs), which offer unique advantages in continuous transformation
modeling compared to traditional residual networks. NijiGAN successfully
transforms real-world scenes into high fidelity anime visuals using half of
Scenimefy's parameters. It employs pseudo-paired data generated through
Scenimefy for supervised training, eliminating dependence on low-quality paired
data and improving the training process. Our comprehensive evaluation includes
ablation studies, qualitative, and quantitative analysis comparing NijiGAN to
similar models. The testing results demonstrate that NijiGAN produces
higher-quality images compared to AnimeGAN, as evidenced by a Mean Opinion

model achieved a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 58.71, outperforming

Significant circular Unruh effect at small acceleration,"We study the transition rates of an atom rotating in a circular orbit, which
is coupled with fluctuating electromagnetic fields in vacuum. We find that when
the rotational angular velocity exceeds the transition frequency of the atom,
the excitation rate can reach the same order of magnitude as the emission rate,
even with an extremely low centripetal acceleration resulting from a very small
orbital radius. For experimentally accessible centripetal accelerations, the
excitation rate of centripetally accelerated atoms can be up to ten to the
power of two hundred thousand times that of linearly accelerated atoms with the
same acceleration. Our result suggests that the circular version of the Unruh
effect can be significant even at very small centripetal accelerations,
contrary to the common belief that a large Unruh effect requires large
acceleration. This finding sheds new light on the experimental detection of the
circular Unruh effect.",2024-12-27T04:45:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19454v1,"Yuebing Zhou, Jiawei Hu, Hongwei Yu"
"Exponentially accurate open quantum simulation via randomized
  dissipation with minimal ancilla","Simulating open quantum systems is an essential technique for understanding
complex physical phenomena and advancing quantum technologies. Some quantum
algorithms for simulating Lindblad dynamics achieve logarithmically short
circuit depth in terms of accuracy $\varepsilon$ by coherently encoding all
possible jump processes with a large ancilla consumption. Minimizing the space
complexity while achieving such a logarithmic depth remains an important
challenge. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating general
Lindblad dynamics with multiple jump operators aimed at an observable
estimation, that achieves both a logarithmically short circuit depth and a
minimum ancilla size. Toward simulating an exponentially accurate Taylor
expansion of the Lindblad propagator to ensure the circuit depth of
$\mathcal{O} (\log(1/\varepsilon))$, we develop a novel random circuit
compilation method that leverages dissipative processes with only a single jump
operator; importantly, the proposed method requires the minimal-size, $4 +
\lceil \log M \rceil$, ancilla qubits where each single jump operator has at
most $M$ Pauli strings. This work represents a significant step towards making

"Signatures of Core-Envelope Rotational Misalignment in the Mixed-Mode
  Asteroseismology of Kepler-56","Existing asteroseismic rotational measurements assume that stars rotate
around a single axis. However, tidal torques from misaligned companions, or
their possible engulfment, may bring the rotational axis of a star's envelope
out of alignment with its core, breaking azimuthal symmetry. I derive
perturbative expressions for asteroseismic signatures of such hitherto
unexamined rotational configurations, under the ``shellular approximation'' of
constant rotation rates on radially stratified mass shells. In the aligned
case, the distribution of power between multiplet components is determined by
the inclination of the rotational axis; radial differential misalignment causes
this to vary from multiplet to multiplet. I examine in particular detail the
phenomenology of gravitoacoustic mixed modes as seen in evolved sub- and red
giants, where near-resonance avoided crossings may break geometrical
degeneracies. Upon applying the revised asteroseismic observational methodology
that results from this theoretical discussion to revisit Kepler-56 -- a red
giant with a misaligned planetary system -- I find that its core and envelope
rotate around different rotational axes. While the rotational axis of its core
is indeed misaligned from the orbit normal of its transiting planets
(consistently with earlier studies), its envelope's rotational axis is close to
lying in the sky plane, and may well be aligned with them. More detailed
asteroseismic modelling, and spectroscopic follow-up, will be required to fully
elucidate the full spin-orbit geometry of the Kepler-56 system, and potentially
discriminate between hypotheses for how it formed.",2024-12-27T04:40:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19451v1,J. M. Joel Ong
"Find the Intention of Instruction: Comprehensive Evaluation of
  Instruction Understanding for Large Language Models","One of the key strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to
interact with humans by generating appropriate responses to given instructions.
This ability, known as instruction-following capability, has established a
foundation for the use of LLMs across various fields and serves as a crucial
metric for evaluating their performance. While numerous evaluation benchmarks
have been developed, most focus solely on clear and coherent instructions.
However, we have noted that LLMs can become easily distracted by
instruction-formatted statements, which may lead to an oversight of their
instruction comprehension skills. To address this issue, we introduce the
Intention of Instruction (IoInst) benchmark. This benchmark evaluates LLMs'
capacity to remain focused and understand instructions without being misled by
extraneous instructions. The primary objective of this benchmark is to identify
the appropriate instruction that accurately guides the generation of a given
context. Our findings suggest that even recently introduced state-of-the-art
models still lack instruction understanding capability. Along with the

Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems,"We consider the classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from
the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is
restricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed
construction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations . The
unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge
symmetry transformation of the equations restricting the trajectories. We
explicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this
gauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional
extrema is not Lagrangian as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian
formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is degenerate, in
general. Alternatively, the equations restricting dynamics could be added to
the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted variation of the
original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the Lagrangian equations
for original variables involving Lagrange multipliers and for Lagrange
multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not equivalent
because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared to the case
of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We illustrate the
general method with two examples. The first example is the particle in central
field with varying trajectories restricted by equation of conservation of
angular momentum. The phase space gets one more dimension, and there is an
extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible for precession of
trajectories. $K=0$ corresponds to the trajectories of usual Lagrangian
dynamics. The second example is the linearized gravity with Einstein-Hilbert
action and the class of varying fields is restricted by linearized Nordstr\""om
equation. This conditional extrema problem is shown to lead to the linearized
Cotton gravity equations.",2024-12-27T04:34:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447v1,"Simon Lyakhovich, nikit Sinelnikov"
